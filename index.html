This is a fascinating, detailed and insightful account of life in a civilian concentration camp as gripping and readable as any tale of adventure.</p><p>Emily Van SickleThe author and her husband Charles were among the thousands of foreign civilians interned by the Japanese on the 48-acre campus of Santo Tomas University in the Philippines. The school was a made-to-order concentration camp enclosed on three sides by high concrete walls and iron bars. There were inadequate sanitary facilities, no sleeping quarters, and very little food. What makes this story unique and ultimately fascinating to read is the special status of the prisoners. Many were businessmen who either had or were able to borrow money, and the Japanese civilians who oversaw the camp allowed buying and trading to go on through the front gates. In 1944, the military took over and treatment predictably worsened. Though the camp was liberated before mass executions could be carried out, the imminent sense of danger is palpable, carrying readers to the final pages. This well-written memoir will be welcome in World War II collections.<br><i>- David Lee Poremba, Detroit P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A History of the Devil</h2><p>A historian turned philosopher argues that evil arises not from the Devil but from the belief in one.

It considers her formal artistic training in the rigid academic atmosphere of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, and her sojourns in Paris in 1930 and 1937, which brought Varo into contact with the surrealist movement of Andr� Breton that was to define her artistic expression for the rest of her career. The main part of the book is devoted to the period following her exile in Mexico in 1940. It was here that Varo&#x2019;s art became fully defined, and where she was recognized and championed by leading intellectual figures, such as the poet Octavio Paz.<br><br>This volume celebrates in 77 beautiful colour paintings the complexity of Varo&#x2019;s art, which defies easy classification. Inspired by the visual forms of surrealist artists, such as Yves Tanguy and Marc�l Jean, but at the same time establishing its own unique vision, the paintings of Remedios Varo evoke a sense of deep mystery that leads us through a complex intellectual world, where cunning, irony and harsh questioning are the cornerstones of art.</p><p></p><h2>Laboratory Manual for Seeley's Anatomy &amp; Physiology</h2><p>Ph.I.L.S. 3.0 is the perfect way to reinforce key physiology concepts with powerful lab experiments.

Units throughout; extensive Appendices of standard materials properties; and, for classroom use, a Solutions Manual is available.</p><p>Professor of Materials Engineering, Purdue University.</p><h2>Hawthorne&#39;s Short Stories</h2><p>Here are the best of Hawthorne&#39;s short stories. There are twenty-four of them -- not only the most familiar, but also many that are virtually unknown to the average reader. The selection was made by Professor Newton Arvin of Smith College, a recognized authority on Hawthorne and a distinguished literary critic as well. His fine introduction admirably interprets Hawthorne&#39;s mind and art.</p><p><b>Nathaniel Hawthorne</b> (1805-64) was an American novelist and short-story writer. He was born in Salem, Massachusetts, and graduated from Bowdoin College. His first novel, <i>Fanshawe, </i>was published anonymously in 1828, followed by several collections of short stories, including <i>Twice-Told Tales </i>and <i>Mosses from an Old Manse. </i>His later novels include<i> The Scarlet Letter, The House of Seven Gables, The Blithedale Romance, </i>and <i>The Marble Faun. <br></i><br><b>Newton Arvin</b> (1900-63) was a literary critic and professor at Smith College known for his influential writings about nineteenth-century American literature. He is the author of biographies of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman, and his biography of Herman Melville won the National Book Award in 1951.The Birthmark<br><br>In the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science, an eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy, who not long before our story opens had made experience of a spiritual affinity more attractive than any chemical one. He had left his laboratory to the care of an assistant, cleared his fine countenance from the furnace smoke, washed the stain of acids from his fingers, and persuaded a beautiful woman to become his wife. In those days when the comparatively recent discovery of electricity and other kindred mysteries of Nature seemed to open paths into the region of miracle, it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy. The higher intellect, the imagination, the spirit, and even the heart might all find their congenial aliment in pursuits which, as some of their ardent votaries believed, would ascend from one step of powerful intelligence to another, until the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force and perhaps make new worlds for himself. We know not whether Aylmer possessed this degree of faith in man's ultimate control over Nature. He had devoted himself, however, too unreservedly to scientific studies ever to be weaned from them by any second passion. His love for his young wife might prove the stronger of the two; but it could only be by intertwining itself with his love of science, and uniting the strength of the latter to his own.<br><br>Such a union accordingly took place, and was attended with truly remarkable consequences and a deeply impressive moral. One day, very soon after their marriage, Aylmer sat gazing at his wife with a trouble in his countenance that grew stronger until he spoke.<br><br>"Georgiana," said he, "has it never occurred to you that the mark upon your cheek might be removed?"<br><br>"No, indeed," said she, smiling; but perceiving the seriousness of his manner, she blushed deeply. "To tell you the truth it has been so often called a charm that I was simple enough to imagine it might be so."<br><br>"Ah, upon another face it might," replied her husband; "but never on yours. No, dearest Georgiana, you came so nearly perfect from the hand of Nature that this slightest possible defect, which we hesitate whether to term a defect or a beauty, shocks me, as being the visible mark of earthly imperfection."<br><br>"Shocks you, my husband!" cried Georgiana, deeply hurt; at first reddening with momentary anger, but then bursting into tears. "Then why did you take me from my mother's side? You cannot love what shocks you!"<br><br>To explain this conversation it must be mentioned that in the centre of Georgiana's left cheek there was a singular mark, deeply interwoven, as it were, with the texture and substance of her face.&nbsp; In the usual state of her complexion &#x2014; a healthy though delicate bloom &#x2014; the mark wore a tint of deeper crimson, which imperfectly defined its shape amid the surrounding rosiness. When she blushed it gradually became more indistinct, and finally vanished amid the triumphant rush of blood that bathed the whole cheek with its brilliant glow. But if any shifting motion caused her to turn pale there was the mark again, a crimson stain upon the snow, in what Aylmer sometimes deemed an almost fearful distinctness. Its shape bore not a little similarity to the human hand, though of the smallest pygmy size. Georgiana's lovers were wont to say that some fairy at her birth hour had laid her tiny hand upon the infant's cheek, and left this impress there in token of of the magic endowments that were to give her such sway over all hearts. Many a desperate swain would have risked life for the privilege of pressing his lips to the mysterious hand. It must not be concealed, however, that the impression wrought by this fairy sign manual varied exceedingly, according to the difference of temperament of the beholders. Some fastidious persons &#x2014; but they were exclusively of her own sex &#x2014; affirmed that the bloody hand, as they chose to call it, quite destroyed the effect of Georgiana's beauty, and rendered her countenance even hideous. But it would be as reasonable to say that one of those small blue stains which sometimes occurred in the purest statuary marble would convert the Eve of Powers to a monster. Masculine observers, if the birthmark did not heighten their admiration, contented themselves with wishing it away, that the world might possess one living specimen of ideal loveliness without the semblance of a flaw. After his marriage, &#x2014;for he thought little or nothing of the matter before,&#x2014; Aylmer discovered that this was the case with himself.<br><br>Had she been less beautiful,&#x2014;if Envy's self could have found aught else to sneer at,&#x2014; he might have felt his affection heightened by the prettiness of this mimic hand, now vaguely portrayed, now lost, now stealing forth again and glimmering to and fro with every pulse of emotion that throbbed within her heart; but seeing her otherwise so perfect, he found this one defect grow more and more intolerable with every moment of their united lives. It was the fatal flaw of humanity which Nature, in one shape or another, stamps ineffaceably on all her productions, either to imply that they are temporary and finite, or that their perfection must be wrought by toil and pain. The crimson hand expressed the ineludible gripe in which mortality clutches the highest and purest of earthly mould, degrading them into kindred with the lowest, and even with the very brutes, like whom their visible frames return to dust. In this manner, selecting it as the symbol of his wife's liability to sin, sorrow, decay, and death, Aylmer's sombre imagination was not long in rendering the birthmark a frightful object, causing him more trouble and horror than ever Georgiana's beauty, whether of soul or sense, had given him delight.</p><h2>AutoCAD 2019 Instructor</h2><p><p> This book is your AutoCAD 2019 Instructor.

SAMMLER&#x2019;S PLANETIf this 1959 novel, one of Saul Bellow&#39;s most beloved, seems to have exceeded its shelf life, it helps to remember that much of the absurdity is intentional: Many believe the title character is a send-up of Hemingway. Joe Barrett is an excellent choice as the narrator of this tale about a rich American who journeys into remotest Africa. His gruff voice is well suited to Henderson, a physically large and garrulous man with a penchant for bombastic dialogue and philosophical ramblings. The voices Barrett gives to the African characters--notably the western-educated King Dahfu--are hardly authentic, but they&#39;re not grating, and some of the discordance can be laid at the feet of Bellow.

Mencken, and Mark Twain. Over the last twenty years he has experimented with satire in its several forms&#x2014;as burlesque, pasquinade, invective, and deadpan jest.</p><br><p>This first assemblage of Lapham&#x2019;s satires presents thirty pieces that hold their currency and humor against the tide of social and political change that has engulfed American society in recent times. He reduces to absurdity many of the topics of the day that are often treated portentiously: Dickens&#x2019;s <i>A Christmas Carol</i> is retold to praise the virtues of remorseless greed; the hydrogen bomb is introduced as a solemn dinner guest who doesn&#x2019;t play tennis or speak English; gene banks take the form of well-trained pigs that accompany their wealthy owners in the first-class cabins of transatlantic jets.</p><br></p><p>Lewis Lapham is the editor of <i>Lapham&#x2019;s Quarterly</i>. Formerly the editor of <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i>, he is the author of several books, including <i>Money and Class in America</i>, <i>Theater of War</i> (The New Press), <i>Gag Rule</i>, and <i>Pretensions to Empire</i> (The New Press). He lives in New York City.<br>Readers of Harper's magazine will likely recognize many of these dispatches from editor Lapham, examining roughly two decades of political and cultural folly. Many essays have aged well, but others have not; a reimagining of A Christmas Carol (Scrooge returns to his miserly self, an ending more in tune with the Contract with America) is loaded to capacity with mid-'90s topical references, and the very subjects of some chapters have faded into obscurity. The analysis of Steve Forbes's political career, for example, is amusing, but may leave readers struggling to recall the candidacy it describes. Every page offers at least one clever turn of phrase and at least one scornful appraisal of people, like the "self-appointed guardians of the nation's conscience" from academia who "wish to be consulted on matters that almost none of them understand." But those who recognize satire primarily in its farcical vein may wonder at some chapters. Is it really satire to point out that media coverage of the deaths of Princess Diana and John F. Kennedy Jr. was ridiculously overblown, or that Rudy Giuliani's attack on the Brooklyn Museum of Art was glaring political opportunism? It is: satire requires only that vice and absurdity be held up to contempt and ridicule, both of which Lapham supplies in erudite abundance. In one essay, he mentions Voltaire, Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce. The entire book displays the skill with which he follows in their footsteps, and in another 20 years, one might expect its better chapters to be held in similar regard. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Behemoth or The Long Parliament</h2><p><i>Behemoth, or The Long Parliament</i> is essential to any reader interested in the historical context of the thought of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679). In <i>De Cive</i> (1642) and <i>Leviathan</i> (1651), the great political philosopher had developed an analytical framework for discussing sedition, rebellion, and the breakdown of authority. <i>Behemoth</i>, completed around 1668 and not published until after Hobbe's death, represents the systematic application of this framework to the English Civil War.<br><br>In his insightful and substantial Introduction, Stephen Holmes examines the major themes and implications of Behemoth in Hobbes's system of thought. Holmes notes that a fresh consideration of Behemoth dispels persistent misreadings of Hobbes, including the idea that man is motivated solely by a desire for self-preservation. Behemoth, which is cast as a series of dialogues between a teacher and his pupil, locates the principal cause of the Civil War less in economic interests than in the stubborn irrationality of key actors. It also shows more vividly than any of Hobbe's other works the importance of religion in his theories of human nature and behavior.</p><p><b>Stephen Holmes</b>, a professor of political science and law at the University of Chicago, is the author of <i>Benjamin Constant and the Making of Modern Liberalism</i>.</p><h2>Star Wars Scrapbook: The Essential Collection</h2><p>Imagine you've been a <i>Star Wars</i> fan from the very beginning.

It has the distinction of being the first English "novel," far surpassing in narrative sophistication such immediate predecessors as Elyot's <i>Image of Governance</i> or Borde's <i>Scoggin's Jests</i>. This edition, besides providing a modernized text of the novel, also identifies the pseudonymous author of <i>Beware the Cat</i> as William Baldwin, better known as editor and principal author of the enormously popular <i>Mirror for Magistrates</i> (1559). The development of early English prose fiction is thoroughly documented in two informative and wide-ranging appendices. William Baldwin's place in this tradition, as well as his innovative narrative art, is discussed in the introduction, which also provides biographical information on the author, historical background to his novel, and insight into the political and religious turmoil of the middle years of the sixteenth century.</p><p><b>William A.

At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C. S. Lewis gives us the correspondence of the worldly-wise old devil to his nephew Wormwood, a novice demon in charge of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man. <i>The Screwtape Letters</i> is the most engaging account of temptation -- and triumph over it -- ever written, offering insights on good vs. evil, repentance, grace, and more.</p><p>This adaptation of C.S. Lewis's biting satire received a 1999 Grammy nomination for best spoken-word performance, and it's easy to see why--the story fits the format perfectly. It's relatively brief (the unabridged reading takes a mere four hours), and contains only one character--the demon Screwtape, who writes letters to his novice nephew Wormwood, instructing him on how to best tempt his "patient" (a wayward soul on earth) into the bosom of "our Lord below." <p> Obviously, the book wasn't written with former Monty Python John Cleese in mind, but it's hard to imagine a better Screwtape. Cleese's voice provides the perfect vehicle for Lewis's dry, razor-edged wit. His uncanny comic timing and ability to milk each phrase for maximum effect betray an infectious enthusiasm for the story. It's clear that he's having a great time reading, and it's impossible not to laugh along with him. This inspired pairing of two of the 20th century's greatest wits makes for a meditation on the dark side of spiritual guidance that's as relevant and funny today as it was in Lewis's war-torn England. (Running time: 4 hours, 3 cassettes) --<i>Andrew Neiland</i></p>His letters are signed, save one, "Your affectionate uncle", yet Uncle Screwtape's purposes in writing to his young nephew are hardly innocent. Penned in a brisk, businesslike style, old Screwtape offers the gullible Tempter Wormword fiendishly clever advice on his most pressing concern: the winning of young lives to the devil.<p>First published in 1941, The Screwtape Letters, a perennial best seller, has earned a place in the library of classics. The truths contained in C. S. Lewis's treatise on human nature are as old as the world, but his witty observations continue to confront and challenge believers and nonbelievers alike.</p><p>The outcome of Screwtape's correspondence is not known. But judging from his final signoff -- "Your increasingly and ravenously affectionate uncle" -- his appetite for evil has not lessened.</p></p><h2>William Faulkner and the Tangible Past: The Architecture of Yoknapatawpha (California Studies in the History of Art)</h2><p>The world of William Faulkner is seen from a new perspective in Thomas Hines's imaginative and many-faceted study. Hines assesses the impact of the built environment on Faulkner's consciousness and shows how the architecture of the writer's fictional county of Yoknapatawpha reflects the actual architecture of Oxford, Mississippi, and neighboring areas. Over 110 distinctive photographs, in both color and black-and-white, beautifully complement the text, making this book both a reading and viewing pleasure.<br><br>Much has been written on the role of nature in Faulkner's work, but architecture and the built environment&#x2014;the opposite of nature&#x2014;have been virtually ignored. Arguing that nature and architecture are of equal importance in Faulkner's cosmos, Hines examines the writer's use of architectural modes&#x2014;primitive, classical, gothic, and modern&#x2014;to demarcate caste and class, to convey mood and ambience, and to delineate character. Hines provides not only another way of understanding Faulkner's work but also a means of appreciating the power of architecture to reflect what Faulkner called "the comedy and tragedy of being alive."<br><br>Hines's gifts as an architectural historian and photographer and his intimate knowledge of Faulkner country are evident throughout this handsome book. Combining cultural, intellectual, architectural, and literary history, <i>William Faulkner and the Tangible Past</i> will take Faulkner lovers, as well as lovers of architecture, on a fascinating tour of Yoknapatawpha County.</p><p>An architectural tour through the landscape upon which William Faulkner based his fictional Yoknapatawpha County. Faulkner was a master at using descriptions of buildings to establish mood and character. Thomas S. Hines, a professor of architecture and history, and a distant relative of Faulkner&#39;s, offers us a readable and wonderfully illustrated guide to the architectural styles that informed Faulkner&#39;s writings."This jewel of a book is a great pleasure to read.

They&#x2019;re taboo. They&#x2019;re embarrassing. They&#x2019;re gross. And due to a crumbling or nonexistent national sex ed program, they are misunderstood. Because of these stigmas, a status quo has been established to exclude people who menstruate from the seat at the decision-making table, creating discriminations like the tampon tax, medicines that favor male biology, and more.<br> <br><i>Period Power</i> aims to explain what menstruation is, shed light on the stigmas and resulting biases, and create a strategy to end the silence and prompt conversation about periods.</p><p>Nadya Okamoto grew up in Portland and currently attends Harvard College. She is the founder and executive director of PERIOD (Period.org), an organization she founded at the age of sixteen, which is now the largest youth-run NGO in women&#x2019;s health, and one of the fastest growing ones here in the United States. She is also the cofounder and spokesperson of Next Fellows (NextFellows.org). In 2017, Nadya ran for office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While she did not win, her campaign team made historic waves in mobilizing young people on the ground and at polls.&nbsp;Period Power CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br>�<br> THE BLOODY TRUTH<p></p> <br>Periods are powerful. Human life would literally not exist without them. They are what make reproduction possible and keep our wombs ready to bear children, if or when we choose to do that.<br> <br>The common experience of menstruation connects people all over the world. Think about it: if you were assigned female at birth, most likely you will get your period on a monthly basis for around forty years of your life. It doesn&#x2019;t matter where you are from, how you identify, or what access to resources you have. And if you don&#x2019;t get your period during menstruation age, it means that your body is telling you either that you are pregnant or that your health needs attention. Though, it&#x2019;s also important to know that when birth control is used without breaks, menstruation may stop as well.<br> <br>To strengthen the way we advocate for periods, we need to understand what a period is in the first place. In the United States we still live in a culture where there is no expectation that we&#x2019;ll learn about periods. Even when it is taught (in schools, by parents, by friends), it&#x2019;s often taught in a way that limits our understanding of what we might call the menstrual experience.<br> <br>Basic sex education&#x2014;if available&#x2014;usually starts in the final years of elementary school and continues into middle school. For those of us who have already experienced it, we might have cringe-worthy memories of our teachers holding up bananas or wooden models of penises to demonstrate how to properly roll a condom on. My favorite memory is of when my eighth-grade science teacher took a red condom, blew it up, and shouted, &#x201c;See? It works for any size!&#x201d;<br> <br>My experience with sex education in elementary and middle school was in gender-segregated classrooms. Teachers often shuffle boys into one classroom and girls into another. In the boys&#x2019; classroom the health teacher might explain that the boys&#x2019; voices are going to get lower, their testicles will descend, and hairs will grow in unfamiliar places on their bodies.<br> <br>In the other classroom the girls are learning about their bodies too. They will learn about their own hair growth, about the development of boobs, and about hormones and the new emotions that they might start to feel. This might also be the first time periods are brought up in the classroom. The teacher will hold up a tampon and pad and explain what products are available and the basics of how to use them. But the experience of actually menstruating will not be covered. You won&#x2019;t find out what the blood will actually look like or what to do if you feel extreme pain while menstruating. The teachers won&#x2019;t tell you what you should do if you stop menstruating suddenly. The option of using sustainable alternatives such as menstrual cups and reusable pads, rather than a typical tampon or pad, will not be discussed.<br> <br>From the moment the classroom separates into boys and girls, the girls learn to feel shame about openly talking about menstruation, and this prevents future conversations and questions from surfacing. Girls learn that the topic of periods is something you either keep to yourself or you mention only to other girls, in private circles. And boys often don&#x2019;t formally learn anything about menstruation. They are taught that it isn&#x2019;t any of their business, that it&#x2019;s weird to even be curious.<br> <br>Menstruator or not, you still have to share spaces with many people who are. Everyone, regardless of sex or gender identity, should know what periods are and should feel comfortable talking about them&#x2014;this is necessary in order to build inclusive and egalitarian communities. So, let&#x2019;s dive in.<br> � WHAT&#x2019;S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PERIOD AND A MENSTRUAL CYCLE? �<p></p> <br>&#x201c;Period&#x201d; and &#x201c;menstrual cycle&#x201d; are two terms that are used to indicate the time of the month when the body excretes blood, but the words don&#x2019;t mean exactly the same thing. The &#x201c;menstrual cycle&#x201d; refers to the approximately twenty-eight-day process during which the body prepares for pregnancy. A &#x201c;period&#x201d; is just one brief stop in a much larger menstrual cycle.<br> <br><br> <br>The diagram above gives us a look into a menstruator&#x2019;s pelvic area, right between the hips. The two ovaries hold the eggs, and the whole menstrual cycle is directed by two of our hormone friends: estrogen and progesterone.<br> <br>At the beginning of each cycle, estrogen and progesterone trigger the creation of the endometrium, which is a lining on the inside walls of the uterus. Made of tissue and blood, the endometrium is spongy enough to make a perfect landing place for a fertilized egg. When pregnancy does occur, the uterus is often referred to as the womb.<br> <br>Ovulation happens when a menstruator&#x2019;s ovaries release a matured egg about halfway through a menstrual cycle. As you can see from the diagram, in order to get to the uterus, the matured egg travels through the fallopian tubes. The egg basically just sits in the fallopian tube or the uterus and waits, hoping to be fertilized by a sperm cell. Most of the time pregnancy does not occur, which causes the uterine lining to break off from the uterine wall and exit the body through the vaginal canal. This action is what we call a period.<br> � THE BLOODY TRUTH ABOUT PERIOD BLOOD �<p></p> <br>When I first got my period, I was scared. I knew what menstruation was, but no one had ever told me how period blood would look, smell, and feel. So, here it is&#x2014;the bloody truth in all its glory:<br> <br>What period blood actually looks like, how it smells, the color, and how much of it comes out will vary across menstrual experiences. There is no &#x201c;normal&#x201d; version of menstruation. All bodies are different, so period experiences will also be different. Yes, the menstrual cycle is approximately a twenty-eight-day interval, but the cycle is rarely precisely twenty-eight days&#x2014;and some menstruators sometimes will bleed between periods.1<br> <br>On average a menstruator will lose anywhere from five to twelve teaspoons, or about thirty to seventy-two milliliters, of blood in one menstrual cycle.2 Sixty milliliters of blood or more is considered a heavy flow. But how can someone measure the amount of blood? Each regular-size tampon holds about five milliliters of blood;3 so this means that if you are using more than twelve tampons per period that are getting fully soaked, then you should go see a doctor. Another way to figure out how much blood you are expelling is to use menstrual cups, which often have marks for measurement on their sides.<br> <br>When period flow gets very heavy, more than eighty milliliters per cycle, it&#x2019;s called menorrhagia, and losing this much blood can cause one to feel tired and short of breath&#x2014;both of which are symptoms of anemia. Having such a heavy flow is not only a hassle because more period products are needed, but it can also be extremely painful. The opposite of this condition, a very light period of less than twenty-five milliliters of blood lost, is called hypomenorrhea.4 So what causes some of us to have only light spotting once a month, and others to experience prolonged menstrual cycles that involve changing pads multiple times in an hour?<br> <br>Menstruators who have had children or are in perimenopause (the phase right before menopause) typically have heavier flows because menorrhagia can be caused by hormone imbalance&#x2014;high estrogen and low progesterone leads to more bleeding and clots (passing more than one per day)&#x2014;but menorrhagia can occur for a number of different reasons, such as certain medications that interfere with blood clotting, uterine fibroids (benign tumors), and polyps (benign growths).5,6 What can you do to regulate or help lessen the pain of period flow? Use the right products for you, eat well, and exercise in a healthy way.7<br> <br>The color of period blood can also be anywhere from dark brown or even black to a very vibrant red color. This difference in color does not necessarily have any implication for one&#x2019;s health when within the red spectrum. The color of the blood is dependent on how long the blood, tissue, or even clots have been exposed to oxygen. It&#x2019;s similar to how your blood changes color if you cut your skin. When you first start to bleed, the color is this very bright red. After letting the cut heal a bit (hopefully with a bandage and disinfectant), the scab that forms is very dark, almost purple. The color of blood darkens with more exposure to oxygen because the pigment concentrates as the water in the blood evaporates.8 The brighter the period blood, the less time it has been in your uterus. The blood flow tends to get a bit heavier on day two or three of your period, so this is when the color of one&#x2019;s period blood might become brighter.9<br> <br>The consistency of period blood is probably what people are most in the dark about. No one really tells you what your period is going to feel like, much less what the actual blood is going to be like. Most of my guy friends assume that period blood is watery, like when you get a bloody nose. Incorrect. Your menstrual blood might be watery some of the time, particularly in the first few cycles or in the final days of your period, but it won&#x2019;t only be like that&#x2014;and it might not be like that at all for some menstruators. Since vaginal mucus also comes out during a period, the discharge is sometimes slippery and feels a bit like jelly. It&#x2019;s also pretty normal for period blood to look a little clumpy, from small blood clots. There is nothing to worry about if any clots appear on a period product or in the toilet. This just means that your body is pushing out the menstrual blood faster than your body can break down the clots. Clots are a concern only if they are the size of a quarter or larger.10<br> <br>Do not feel embarrassed about how your period blood smells, and definitely don&#x2019;t try to fix it by douching. Douching and forcibly cleaning out your uterus can actually be very unhealthy because it changes the uterus&#x2019;s natural acidity. It is totally normal for your vagina and period blood to have distinct odors. In fact, menstrual blood is supposed to have that smell. Some might describe this smell as a bit metallic. It isn&#x2019;t just blood you&#x2019;re smelling; it&#x2019;s also mucus and tissue from the lining, as well as bacteria and other fluids. And the smell is stronger when these things sit in your uterus for longer.<br> <br>If your vaginal discharge or period blood starts to have a fishy scent, that&#x2019;s when you should see a doctor. There are some common infections, such as bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, that are known to have a fishy scent. Luckily, these infections can be easily cured with antibiotics.11 The truth is, after the first few times, you&#x2019;ll get familiar with your period, and the smell of your own period blood and vaginal discharge will become completely recognizable. So, if you suddenly start to notice that it smells different, then you know to go to the doctor and ask questions.12<br> <br>Pooping more during your period? Also totally normal. When progesterone levels suddenly drop immediately after your period starts (after reaching maximum production right before), that sort of release can cause your bowels to open up a bit more.13<br> � WHO MENSTRUATES? �<p></p> <br>Menstruation usually starts when a person is between ten and fifteen years old, with the average age of menarche being twelve years old. There is no &#x201c;correct&#x201d; age when someone should get their first period, and there are a lot of biological and environmental factors that affect when menarche begins.14 Usually, in the six months leading up to menarche, a menstruator will notice more vaginal discharge than usual.15 Vaginal discharge is absolutely normal: it&#x2019;s a sort of housekeeping function where glands in the vagina and cervix produce fluids to help carry dead cells and any bacteria out of the body. The discharge can vary in color and texture but is usually a white or cloudy-colored thick paste.16<br> <br>There are theories about the age at which menarche occurs and what it can tell you about your future and current life, especially since studies have shown that both hormones and stress can influence when you get your period. Some of these theories say that an early first period can signify an unsettled childhood, and that if menarche occurs at either a very young age or a very late age, that can mean a higher chance of heart disease.17 Another observation is that experiencing menarche at a younger age is linked to breast cancer.18 But ultimately the most important thing is that the first period (when blood actually comes out of the vagina) indicates that a menstruator has the ability to get pregnant.<br> <br>The menstrual career (a term that we&#x2019;ll use to refer to the years when menstruation happens) extends until menopause occurs. After menopause happens, a person can no longer get pregnant.19 There is no process to determine when a menstruator can expect to experience menopause, but in the United States the average age is fifty-two.20 The process of menopause can be a strenuous one that may involve vaginal dryness, hot flashes and chills, abrupt mood changes, trouble sleeping, lower energy, and so on. Of course, different people will experience different symptoms, but having irregular periods during perimenopause is very common. A menstruator is considered to be in menopause when a full twelve months have passed without a period.21<br> <br>It is not only women who menstruate. Some transgender men and people who identify as nonbinary or genderqueer (or others) but who were assigned female at birth might still experience periods. For many readers this may be the first time you&#x2019;ve thought about the intersectionality of gender and periods before, but it is an extremely important discussion to have early on, to ensure that the Menstrual Movement is inclusive of all period experiences. I will admit that in my early days of menstrual activism, I did not consider that anyone other than women could experience menstruation. However, since learning about it, gender inclusivity when talking about periods has become one of my priorities.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s important to use language that is inclusive of all menstrual experiences. For transgender men and genderqueer people (and others) who still experience menstruation and have uteruses, vaginas, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, periods can be very difficult&#x2014;not only because of menstrual health management, but also because menstruation is a reminder that their sex (assigned at birth) does not match their gender identity. As you may have noticed, I avoid using terms such as &#x201c;feminine hygiene&#x201d; and &#x201c;feminine products&#x201d; in an effort to be gender-inclusive.<br> � WHEN YOUR PERIOD DOESN&#x2019;T COME �<p></p> <br>The word &#x201c;menarche&#x201d; is made up of two Greek words: &#x201c;men,&#x201d; which means &#x201c;month,&#x201d; and &#x201c;arche,&#x201d; which means &#x201c;beginning.&#x201d; So the term literally means &#x201c;the first occurrence of a monthly event.&#x201d; It is the beginning of something that starts when you&#x2019;re young and continues through much of your life.<br> <br>&#x201c;Amenorrhea&#x201d; is the word used to describe when menstruation is absent for someone who is of menstruating age&#x2014;when they have missed three or more of their periods or haven&#x2019;t gotten their period before the age of fifteen. Amenorrhea is usually caused by pregnancy, breast-feeding, or menopause. When someone gets pregnant, they do not experience menstruation because the uterine lining is needed to cultivate the fertilized egg.22 Ame...</p><h2>Everyday Object Lessons for Youth Groups</h2><p>You may not like it that students forgot your talk on temptation, but remembered your mouse-trap object lesson . . . . . . but the fact remains that nothing brings a lesson to life more vividly and concretely--or wakes up a drowsy Sunday school class faster--than a good object lesson.

School practices continue to send boys and girls down different life paths, too often treating them not as different genders but as different species. Teachers and parents often miss the subtle signs of sexism in classrooms. Through firsthand observations and up-to-the-minute research, <i>Still Failing at Fairness</i> brings the gender issue into focus. <br> <br> The authors provide an in-depth account of how girls' and boys' educations are compromised from elementary school through college, and offer practical advice for teachers and parents who want to make a positive difference. The authors examine today's pressing issues -- the lack of enforcement for Title IX, the impact of the backlash against gender equity, the much-hyped "boys' crisis," hardwired brain differences, and the recent growth of singlesex public schools. This book documents how teaching, current testing practices, and subtle cultural attitudes continue to short-circuit both girls and boys of every race, social class, and ethnicity.

The study of animal learning and conditioning can be approached from two very different perspectives. The psychologist can focus directly on behaviour, relying on the conditioning experiment in his attempt to formulate behavioural laws and principles which will transcend the confines of the laboratory. The learning theorist however, is concerned not with behavioural change per se but rather with the way in which animals acquire knowledge through experience: the types of relationship to which they are sensitive, their representation of their knowledge about these and the mechanisms that control these representations. Dr Dickinson provides an integrated survey of the experimental and theoretical work which was being carried out as he wrote. The book will continue to interest scholars of animal learning theory.</p><p>A general but comprehensive 1980 study of the way in which animals learn and in particular, learn about the relationship between events in their environment.

The author maintains that this rich body of knowledge about fertility control&#x2015;widely held in the ancient world&#x2015;was gradually lost over the course of the Middle Ages, becoming nearly extinct by the early modern period. The reasons for this he suggests, stemmed from changes in the organization of medicine. As university medical training became increasingly important, physicians&#x2019; ties with folk traditions were broken. The study of birth control methods was just not part of the curriculum.</p><p>In an especially telling passage, Riddle reveals how Renaissance humanists were ill equipped to provide accurate translations of ancient texts concerning abortifacients due to their limited experience with women&#x2019;s ailments. Much of the knowledge about contraception belonged to an oral culture&#x2015;a distinctively female-centered culture. From ancient times until the seventeenth century, women held a monopoly on birthing and the treatment of related matters; information passed from midwife to mother, from mother to daughter. Riddle reflects on the difficulty of finding traces of oral culture and the fact that the little existing evidence is drawn from male writers who knew that culture only from a distance. Nevertheless, through extraordinary scholarly sleuthing, the author pieces together the clues and evaluates the scientific merit of these ancient remedies in language that is easily understood by the general reader. His findings will be useful to anyone interested in learning whether it was possible for premodern people to regulate their reproduction without resorting to the extremities of dangerous surgical abortions, the killing of infants, or the denial of biological urges.</p></p><p>John M. Riddle is Chair of the History Department and Alumni Distinguished Professor, North Carolina State University.&#x201c;Riddle&#x2019;s study is a true turning point in the history of contraception and abortion, which may have large implications for the history of the medical and psychic experience of women in antiquity, folk medicine, and premodern demography.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>W. V. Harris</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Riddle shows us that ancient contraceptive medical practices were safe, effective and commonly used. Sociological studies on their use remain to be carried out. But it is possible that, between the Middle Ages and the rise of modern contraception, the well-off and city dwellers had little access to effective contraception, thanks to the growth of conventional medicine and the soaring social power of the physician. This is just one of the many intriguing lines of investigation to arise from this book, which shines a different light on what we are generally taught about the &#x2018;progress&#x2019; of the modern world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michel Raymond</b><b>, </b><b><i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Riddle&#x2019;s] findings carry important implications for the history of theology, casuistry, pastoral care, social history, the history of sexuality, and the history of popular culture, as well as the history of botany, pharmacy, medicine, and biochemistry...

But as contest judge Louise Gl�ck notes in her foreword, &#x201c;The miracle of this book is the degree to which Ken Chen manages to be both exhilaratingly modern (anti-catharsis, anti-epiphany) while at the same time never losing his attachment to voice, and the implicit claims of voice: these are poems of intense feeling. . . .

Yet his verse and prose stand at the farthest possible remove from the memoirlike poems, and the poems of first-person identity, that have characterized so much recent verse about U.S. immigrant life. Instead, Chen is experimental in the best and broadest sense of the term: each new page brings an experiment in self-presentation, in sentence, syntax, or (long) line. Prose poems digress into semantic analysis (Love Is Like Tautology in the Same Way Like Is Like Tautology); open-field verse resembles now an alienated, impersonal short story, now a page from an anguished diary: He studies the ceiling for hours before he sleeps&#x2014;for the ceiling is ours./ He wore the bedroom ceiling as his eyelid. Self-consciousness (about travel, about voice) does not take him away from his sense of himself: rather, it becomes him, as when he begins: The first sentence of this poem is not about you./ In this respect, it is unlike the last sentence and my heart. Chen's parents appear as characters in the anti-novel, anti-memoir, first-person sequence.

He was perhaps the most important philosophical thinker to appear in Latin Christendom between Augustine in the fifth century and Anselm in the eleventh. In this volume, Deirdre Carabine provides a clear and accessible introduction--the only one available in the English language--to the thought of this important figure.<br>In part I, Carabine describes the intellectual revival of the ninth century and situates Eriugena's role within that movement. She looks closely at Eriugena's life and intellectual achievements, including his contribution to the theological controversy on predestination and his roles as teacher and translator of Greek thought. She also examines the Periphyson, undoubtedly Eriugena's most original and important work. In part II, Carabine discusses Eriugena's metaphysics, the structure of reality, the theocentric character of creation, and the role of the trinity and the primordial causes. In particular, she explores Eriugena's employment of negative theology and his understanding of human nature. In conclusion, part III looks at Eriugena's interpretation of the return of all things to their source, including his belief that all people, saints and sinners alike, will return to paradise to the "vision" of a transcendent God.<br>Revealing the unique and compelling nature of Eriugena's thought, and showing why his work continues to appeal to a modern audience, this volume is required reading for students and scholars of medieval philosophy and theology.<br></p><p><br>Deirdre Carabine is Professor and Director of the Institute of Ethics and Development Studies at Uganda Martyrs University.<br>Dierdre Carabine analyzes very well Eriugena's fourfold division of nature into that which creates and is not created; that which is created and creates; that which is created and does not create; and that which is not created and does not create.

Victor Terras argues eloquently that Russian literature has reflected, defined, and shaped the nation&#x2019;s beliefs and goals, and he sets his survey against a background of social and political developments and religious and philosophic thought.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Terras traces a rich literary heritage that encompasses Russian folklore of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, medieval literature that in style and substance drew on the Byzantine tradition, and literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when Russia passed through a succession of literary schools&#x2014;neoclassicism, sentimentalism, romanticism, and realism&#x2014;imported from the West. Terras then moves on to the masterful realist fiction of Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoi during the second half of the nineteenth century, showing how it was a catalyst for the social and cultural advances following the reforms of Alexander II. In discussing the period preceding the revolution of 1917, Terras links the literary movements with parallel developments in the theater, music, and the visual arts, explaining that these all placed Russia in the forefront of European modernism. Terras divides Russian literature after the revolution into �migr� and Soviet writing, and he demonstrates how the latter acted as a propaganda tool of the Communist party. He concludes his survey with the dissident movement that followed Stalin&#x2019;s death, arguing that the movement again made literature a leader in the struggle for freedom of thought, genuine relevance, and communion with Western culture.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Idea Factory: Learning to Think at M.I.T.</h2><p>A former student remembers MIT&#39;s rigorous, challenging, and intense program, an academic system that molds America&#39;s finest scientists</p><p>Pepper White owns the consulting firm LCI Energy.An informative and entertaining report on how a Johns Hopkins graduate faced the challenge of his young life when he embarked on a master's program in engineering at one of the toughest science schools on earth. Among the most intimidating credentials to go for in the field of technology are ``MIT cubed''--a bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree from the venerable Massachusetts Institute of Technology. North Carolina native White, son of a musician and a writer and product of a ``well-rounded'' environmental-engineering and liberal-arts education at Johns Hopkins, would have been happy with MIT simple--a master's degree in engineering. But even that accomplishment seemed dauntingly unreachable as, on registration day, he traversed MIT's infinite corridor from Building 13 to Building 6, still expecting to learn that his admission to MIT's graduate school was the result of a clerical error. From his first days spent floundering through classroom lectures (it was several semesters before White learned what a scientific model is)-- buddying up to millionaire professors who'd built companies around their patented inventions, attempting to solve technical conundrums and build miniature machines--to the final dash to the finish as other students fell victim to suicide and burnout, White struggled to maneuver through an intellectual boot camp while trying to maintain a modicum of emotional equilibrium. Here, he plays his advantage as a liberal-arts type who's a semi-outsider to full advantage as he searches for the meaning behind the madness. Despite his denunciations of MIT's merciless environment, his writing itself stands as a heartening example of MIT's broader aim- -to teach its students how to think. Required reading for all college applicants with a yen for science. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His big break came in 1946 with the publication of Dark Passage, which was made into a film starring Bogart and Bacall. During his life he wrote many short stories, film treatments, scripts for radio serials such as Superman, and seventeen novels including Shoot the Pianist (filmed by Truffaut). He died in 1967.Another piece of pulp fiction, Goodis's 1953 noirish novel portrays the story of protagonist Bill Kerrigan, a poor street-hardened man who marries wealthy Loretta Channing. Kerrigan, however, soon learns that class is something you can't buy and once a street punk, always a street punk. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>War in the Middle Ages (English and French Edition)</h2><p>A history of medieval warfare in Europe covers the fifth through the fifteenth century and discusses armor, artillery, strategy, and courage</p><p>Covering the ten centuries following the fall of Rome, War in the Middle Ages engages all aspects of its subject, including the military customs and conditions of the various Western European states; armor and weaponry recruitment; and rules of combat developed to limit bloodshed. <p>Philippe Contamine writes with an awareness that, in both theory and fact, medieval warfare was constantly evolving. He opens with a chapter on Roman military disintegration and the practice of warfare in the barbarian kingdoms erected on the empire's ruins. He then shows how feudalization multiplied conflicts, and describes the resulting growth of the "great stone civilization" of the castle. In the area of military method, he emphasizes three innovations: gunpowder, standing armies and the increased use of infantry, supplying in each case a wealth of data and documentation.</p> <p>Contamine traces the rise of a new literature of strategy and changes in the concept of courage which he puts in the context of actual risk. He points out that the chivalric ideals of the later Middle Ages operated within narrow limits, outside which aristocrats and commoners freely slaughtered each other. Contamine also analyzes the theories of just and unjust war that developed at this time, and illustrates a phenomenon more typical of the period; the religious glorification of the warrior.</p> <p>Ever mindful of the chaos and devastation that war brings, War in the Middle Ages nonetheless offers a clear and consistent picture of the military ethos of a millennium.</p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century</h2><p>How did ordinary people live through the extraordinary changes that have swept across modern China? How did peasants transform themselves into urbanites? How did the citizens of Shanghai cope with the epic upheavals&#x2015;revolution, war, and again revolution&#x2015;that shook their lives? Even after decades of scholarship devoted to modern Chinese history, our understanding of the daily lives of the common people of China remains sketchy and incomplete. In this carefully researched study, Hanchao Lu weaves rich documentary data with ethnographic surveys and interviews to reconstruct the fabric of everyday life in China's largest and most complex city in the first half of this century.</p><p>"From Hanchao Lu's clear and lively descriptions of Shanghai in the early twentieth century, we learn about the patterns of alleyways, design of row houses, rules for subletting, shapes of door-knockers, springs in rickshaw cushions, calls of hawkers, sidewalk haircuts, factory work, how nightsoil pots were emptied and cleaned, and the responsibility of neighbors to keep their noses in one another's affairs. We understand, in short, the base from which everything else about Shanghai at the time should be understood.

His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for <i>Across the River and into the Trees,</i> the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess. A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i> stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway's last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O'Hara in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> to call him "the most important author since Shakespeare."</p><p>Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>They started two hours before daylight, and at first, it was not necessary to break the ice across the canal as other boats had gone on ahead. In each boat, in the darkness, so you could not see, but only hear him, the poler stood in the stern, with his long oar. The shooter sat on a shooting stool fastened to the top of a box that contained his lunch and shells, and the shooter's two, or more, guns were propped against the load of wooden decoys. Somewhere, in each boat, there was a sack with one or two live mallard hens, or a hen and a drake, and in each boat there was a dog who shifted and shivered uneasily at the sound of the wings of the ducks that passed overhead in the darkness.<br><br>Four of the boats went on up the main canal toward the big lagoon to the north. A fifth boat had already turned off into a side canal. Now, the sixth boat turned south into a shallow lagoon, and there was no broken water.<br><br>It was all ice, new-frozen during the sudden, windless cold of the night. It was rubbery and bending against the thrust of the boatman's oar. Then it would break as sharply as a pane of glass, but the boat made little forward progress.<br><br>"Give me an oar," the shooter in the sixth boat said. He stood up and braced himself carefully. He could hear the ducks passing in the darkness, and feel the restless lurching of the dog. To the north he heard the sound of breaking ice from the other boats.<br><br>"Be careful," the poler in the stern said. "Don't tip the boat over."<br><br>"I am a boatman, too," the shooter said.<br><br>He took the long oar the boatman handed him and reversed it so he could hold it by the blade. Holding the blade he reached forward and punched the handle through the ice. He felt the firm bottom of the shallow lagoon, put his weight on the top of the wide oar-blade, and holding with both hands and, first pulling, then shoving, until the pole-hold was well to the stern, he drove the boat ahead to break the ice. The ice broke like sheets of plate glass as the boat drove into it, and onto it, and astern the boatman shoved them ahead into the broken passage.<br><br>After a while, the shooter, who was working hard and steadily and sweating in his heavy clothes, asked the boatman, "Where is the shooting barrel?"<br><br>"Off there to the left. In the middle of the next bay."<br><br>"Should I turn for it now?"<br><br>"As you wish."<br><br>"What do you mean, as I wish? You know the water. Is there water to carry us there?"<br><br>"The tide is low. Who knows?"<br><br>"It will be daylight before we get there if we don't hurry."<br><br>The boatman did not answer.<br><br>All right, you surly jerk, the shooter thought to himself. We are going to get there. We've made two-thirds of the way now and if you are worried about having to work to break ice to pick up birds, that is altogether too bad.<br><br>"Get your back in it, jerk," he said in English.<br><br>"What?" the boatman asked in Italian.<br><br>"I said let's go. It's going to be light."<br><br>It was daylight before they reached the oaken staved hogshead sunk in the bottom of the lagoon. It was surrounded by a sloping rim of earth that had been planted with sedge and grass, and the shooter swung carefully up onto this, feeling the frozen grasses break as he stepped on them. The boatman lifted the combination shooting stool and shell box out of the boat and handed it to the shooter, who leaned over and placed it in the bottom of the big barrel.<br><br>The shooter, wearing his hip boots and an old combat jacket, with a patch on the left shoulder that no one understood, and with the slight light places on the straps, where stars had been removed, climbed down into the barrel and the boatman handed him his two guns.<br><br>He placed them against the wall of the barrel and hung his other shell bag between them, hanging it on two hooks built into the wall of the sunken barrel. Then he leaned the guns against each side of the shell bag.<br><br>"Is there water?" he asked the boatman.<br><br>"No water," the boatman said.<br><br>"Can you drink the lagoon water?"<br><br>"No. It is unhealthy."<br><br>The shooter was thirsty from the hard work of breaking the ice and driving the boat in and he felt his anger rise, and then held it, and said, "Can I help you in the boat to break ice to put out the decoys?"<br><br>"No," the boatman said and shoved the boat savagely out onto the thin sheet ice that cracked and ripped as the boat drove up onto it. The boatman commenced smashing at the ice with the blade of his oar and then started tossing decoys out to the side and behind him.<br><br>He's in a beautiful mood, the shooter thought. He's a big brute, too. I worked like a horse coming out here. He just pulled his weight and that's all. What the hell is eating him? This is his trade isn't it?<br><br>He arranged the shooting stool so he would have the maximum swing to left and right, opened a box of shells, and filled his pockets and opened another of the boxes of shells in the shell bag so he could reach into it easily. In front of him, where the lagoon lay glazed in the first light, was the black boat and the tall, heavily built boatman smashing with his oar at the ice and tossing decoys overboard as though he were ridding himself of something obscene.<br><br>It was getting lighter now and the shooter could see the low line of the near point across the lagoon. Beyond that point he knew there were two other shooting posts and far beyond it there was more marsh and then the open sea. He loaded both his guns and checked the position of the boat that was putting out decoys.<br><br>From behind him, he heard the incoming whisper of wings and he crouched, took hold of his right hand gun with his right hand as he looked up from under the rim of the barrel, then stood to shoot at the two ducks that were dropping down, their wings set to brake, coming down dark in the gray dim sky, slanting toward the decoys.<br><br>His head low, he swung the gun on a long slant, down, well and ahead of the second duck, then without looking at the result of his shot he raised the gun smoothly, up, up ahead and to the left of the other duck that was climbing to the left and as he pulled, saw it fold in flight and drop among the decoys in the broken ice. He looked to his right and saw the first duck a black patch on the same ice. He knew he had shot carefully on the first duck, far to the right of where the boat was, and on the second, high out and to the left, letting the duck climb far up and to the left to be sure the boat was out of any line of fire. It was a lovely double, shot exactly as he should have shot, with complete consideration and respect for the position of the boat, and he felt very good as he reloaded.<br><br>"Listen," the man in the boat called. "Don't shoot toward the boat."<br><br>I'll be a sad son of a bitch, the shooter said to himself. I will indeed.<br><br>"Get your decoys out," he called to the man in the boat. "But get them out fast. I won't shoot until they are all out. Except straight overhead."<br><br>The man in the boat said nothing that could be heard.<br><br>I can't figure it, the shooter thought to himself. He knows the game. He knows I split the work, or more, coming out. I never shot a safer or more careful duck in my life than that. What's the matter with him? I offered to put the dekes out with him. The hell with him.<br><br>Out on the right now, the boatman was still chopping angrily at the ice, and tossing out the wooden decoys in a hatred that showed in every move he made.<br><br>Don't let him spoil it, the shooter told himself. There won't be much shooting with this ice unless the sun should melt it later on. You probably will only have a few birds, so don't let him spoil it for you. You don't know how many more times you will shoot ducks and do not let anything spoil it for you.<br><br>He watched the sky lightening beyond the long point of marsh, and turning in the sunken barrel, he looked out across the frozen lagoon, and the marsh, and saw the snow-covered mountains a long way off. Low as he was, no foothills showed, and the mountains rose abruptly from the plain. As he looked toward the mountains he could feel a breeze on his face and he knew, then, the wind would come from there, rising with the sun, and that some birds would surely come flying in from the sea when the wind disturbed them.<br><br>The boatman had finished putting out the decoys. They were in two bunches, one straight ahead and to the left toward where the sun would rise, and the other to the shooter's right. Now he dropped over the hen mallard with her string and anchor, and the calling duck bobbed her head under water, and raising and dipping her head, splashed water onto her back.<br><br>"Don't you think it would be good to break more ice around the edges?" the shooter called to the boatman. "There's not much water to attract them."<br><br>The boatman said nothing but commenced to smash at the jagged perimeter of ice with his oar. This ice breaking was unnecessary and the boatman knew it. But the shooter did not know it and he thought, I do not understand him but I must not let him ruin it. I must keep it entire and not let him do it. Every time you shoot now can be the last shoot and no stupid son of a bitch should be allowed to ruin it. Keep your temper, boy, he told himself.<br><br>Copyright � 1950 by Ernest Hemmingway<br><br>Copyright renewed � 1978 by Mary Hemmingway</p><h2>The Rise of Brandenburg-Prussia (Lancaster Pamphlets)</h2><p>Incorporating international and domestic relations and economic and cultural influences, Shennan surveys the rise of Prussia from the early 17th century to 1740, highlighting and evaluating the role of its rulers and their idiosyncracies.</p><p>Margaret Shennan is currently Consultant for European Programmes at Lancaster University...."this is a readable, worthwhile book that will well serve its purpose in introducing students to Prussian history."<br>-"German Studies Review <br></p><h2>The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr. : Rediscovering Precious Values July 1951-November 1955 (Papers of Martin Luther King)</h2><p>Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ideas&#x2015;his call for racial equality, his faith in the ultimate triumph of justice, his insistence on the power of nonviolence to bring about a major transformation of American society&#x2015;are as vital and timely as ever.

In his account of the economic, social, intellectual, and governmental structure and development of pre-revolutionary Europe, Doyle stresses throughout the importance of economic and social trends, and places emphasis on the analysis of the structure of society as well as the narration of events. He shows how the contradictions of the old order contributed to a crisis which affected several of the major states in the late eighteenth century, when the growth of governmental power led to a series of clashes between governments and governing classes. Out of these conflicts, particularly in France, arose a revolutionary crisis. The nature of this crisis, and the impact of the change it produced, are examined in detail in the final section of the book. For this second edition, Doyle has revised the text of the book, and comprehensively updated the Bibliography.<br></p><p>William Doyle is at University of Bristol.<br>"Extremely stimulating....Students for years to come will benefit from the wide-ranging intelligence with which he has attacked his very demanding subject."-- <em>History</em><p></p><br>"An excellent book, clearly set out and elegantly composed."-- <em>European Studies Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Real Estate Finance: Theory and Practice</h2><p>The core of this text is based on sound economic and finance principles to promote a greater understanding of how real estate financial markets work.

The book is very thorough and complete and at the same time small enough to fit into a (fairly large) pocket. It is written by three experts in the field of cardiac and respiratory auscultation. The book provides step-by-step instructions on how to identify, interpret and differentiate normal heart and lung sounds, abnormal heart and lung sounds, murmurs and arrhythmias. Complete with pre as well as post reading &#39;test&#39;, the book and CD will tell you how much of different heart and lung sounds you already knew before entering the &#39;course&#39; and how much you have learned from reading the book and listening to the CD. The book is divided into four chapters as follows: Heart sounds, Murmurs, Arrhythmias, and Lung sounds. Each chapter begins with clearly stated objectives followed by a pre-test to evaluate your level of knowledge beforehand. After reading the text and listening to the CD there is an appropriate post-test to evaluate what you have learned. Bothe simulated sounds and natural sounds from clinical cases are presented on the CD. Simulated sounds allow the listener to focus on heart sounds without the distraction of breathing sounds and artifacts. Natural sounds of murmurs and abnormal respiration are included to represent the clinical situation. Graphic presentations of ECG&#39;s and phonocardiogram&#39;s accompany the heart sounds for clarity. This appears to be a very efficient way on conveying knowledge to the reader. Each chapter is also equipped with tables for a quick reference of differential diagnoses for different auscultatory phenomena, making the book very useful as a handbook to be used in day-to-day practice. In summary, this book and CD are excellent tools to help learn the difficult art of auscultation and is useful for the veterinary student as well as the experienced clinician.

In this wide-ranging and provocative book, Kenneth Scheve and David Stasavage ask when and why countries tax their wealthiest citizens&#x2015;and their answers may surprise you.</p><p><i>Taxing the Rich</i> draws on unparalleled evidence from twenty countries over the last two centuries to provide the broadest and most in-depth history of progressive taxation available. Scheve and Stasavage explore the intellectual and political debates surrounding the taxation of the wealthy while also providing the most detailed examination to date of when taxes have been levied against the rich and when they haven't. Fairness in debates about taxing the rich has depended on different views of what it means to treat people as equals and whether taxing the rich advances or undermines this norm. Scheve and Stasavage argue that governments don't tax the rich just because inequality is high or rising&#x2015;they do it when people believe that such taxes compensate for the state unfairly privileging the wealthy. Progressive taxation saw its heyday in the twentieth century, when compensatory arguments for taxing the rich focused on unequal sacrifice in mass warfare. Today, as technology gives rise to wars of more limited mobilization, such arguments are no longer persuasive.</p><p><i>Taxing the Rich</i> shows how the future of tax reform will depend on whether political and economic conditions allow for new compensatory arguments to be made.</p></p><p><p>"This book pulls together a vast array of evidence and develops a collection of compelling arguments that enhance our understanding of the prospects for redistributive taxation in modern economies. Drawing from a wealth of different country experiences, <i>Taxing the Rich</i> will appeal to a wide range of readers in economics and political science and inform current policy debates."<b>--Timothy Besley, London School of Economics</b></p><p>"This is a fascinating book. In a comprehensive and accessible manner, Scheve and Stasavage trace the rise and fall of sharply progressive taxation of income and inheritance in America, Europe, and Japan over the past century. They stress the key role played by mass mobilization and compensatory claims and provide critical insights into the conditions that could lead to the return of high tax rates on the rich. A must-read."<b>--Thomas Piketty, author of <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i></b></p><p>"Scheve and Stasavage provide a thoughtful historical and comparative perspective on the key question of why countries choose to impose high taxes on the rich. In this important and timely book, they elegantly challenge several common theories that seek to explain why countries increase taxes on the wealthy. Their findings nicely explain past tax treatment and provide a sobering prediction of future tax burdens for those at the top of the income and wealth distribution."<b>--Eric M. Zolt, UCLA School of Law</b></p><p>"Why have the rich been spared greater taxation despite the massive rise in inequality that has occurred in advanced democracies in recent decades? This fascinating book provides a clear answer: governments tax the rich not to undo inequality, but to compensate for sacrifices being asked of the non-rich. <i>Taxing the Rich</i> is a model of social science research, firmly grounded in systematic data analysis as well as historical case studies."<b>--Dani Rodrik, author of <i>Economics Rules: The Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal Science</i></b></p><p>"This thought-provoking book combines historical erudition and statistical analysis to reinterpret the rise and fall of progressive taxation. It persuasively argues that mass wars gave rise to the 'conscription of wealth,' and it suggests that today's asymmetric crises are unlikely to generate broad support for more taxation of the rich."<b>--Bernard Salani�, author of <i>The Economics of Taxation</i></b></p><p>"Scheve and Stasavage provide an engaging analytical history of taxation of the rich in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe from 1800 to the present.

In this beautiful and beautifully written book, they open our minds' eyes to the thrillingly enigmatic world that we inhabit, embody, and create.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Harold McGee, author of <i>On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Seemingly invisible objects such as viruses and molecules are imaged in rich detail through high-powered microscopes and photography.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Science News</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Whitesides, a professor at Harvard University, is one of the most productive chemists in the world and arguably one of the most inventive. He brings this spirit to the book, an entertaining jaunt through the world of the micro- and nanoscale. The short essays, each dripping with enthusiasm for the topic, are roughly themed around the importance of scientific endeavour on this scale to such areas as medicine, modern computing and the quantum world. It's not just the text that playfully explores some of the stranger aspects of the invisible world. Frankel's photography can be equally creative, most obviously in a photo of a quantum apple with a shadow that appears to belong to a cube. The pictures are a mix of traditional photography, CGI and images produced using various microscopic techniques, and are dazzling in the best coffee-table tradition. The text is just as vibrant, which makes cover-to-cover reading a slightly exhausting experience&#x2015;but worth it when it rewards the reader with such gems as why young children at a party behave like cellular molecules, or how Beethoven had much in common with plants.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Colin Barras</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Scientist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>No Small Matter</i> conveys science on the nanoscale through a remarkable series of photographs...

Anyone who has run a company, raised a family, lead an army, or coached a team struggles to find the key to help others excel and realize their potential. It is surprising how often we resort to criticism vs. an approach that actually results in a better worker and a better person.&nbsp;</p> <p>What if we could speak <i>Words of Life</i> that transform those under our influence and ignite fires of intrinsic motivation? What if those we lead found great purpose in what they do and worked at their jobs with all their heart? Isn&#x2019;t that what leaders, parents and teachers really want? Ultimately, don&#x2019;t we hope to foster intrinsic motivation so that the individuals we lead become better employees, better students or better athletes? Recent discoveries of brain science and the wisdom of top CEO&#x2019;s that Dr. Tim Irwin interviewed for this book give us the answers we&#x2019;ve long sought.</p> <p>In most organizations, the methods used to provide feedback to employees such as performance appraisal or multi-rater feedback systems<i>, in fact, accomplish the exact opposite of what we intend. </i>We inadvertently speak <i>Words of Death.</i> Brain science tells us that these methods tend to engage a natural &#x201c;negativity bias&#x201d; that is hardwired in us all.</p> <p>Science in recent years discovered that affirmation sets in motion huge positive changes in the brain. It releases certain neuro chemicals associated with well-being and higher performance. Amazingly, criticism creates just the opposite neural reaction. The most primitive part of the brain goes into hyper defense mode, compromising our performance, torpedoing our motivation and limiting access to our higher-order strengths.</p> How do we redirect employees who are out-of-line without engaging our natural &#x201c;negativity bias?&#x201d; Leaders must forever ban the term, &#x201c;Constructive Criticism.&#x201d; Brain science tells us that we can establish a connection between the <i>employee&#x2019;s work and his or her aspirations.</i> This book calls for a new approach to align workers with an organization&#x2019;s mission, strategy and goals, called <i>Alliance Feedback.</i></p><p><p><b>Praise for Extraordinary Influence</b> </p><p>"Leadership is a people game and in <i>Extraordinary Influence,</i> Tim Irwin outlines a powerful approach to motivating others.

Even before a vase became a painted masterpiece, its graceful lines and elegant proportions made it a masterpiece of form. <br><br> <em>Athenian Vase Construction</em> details in a comprehensive, step-by-step fashion the manner in which the major Athenian vases were made. Photographs of pottery from the Getty Museum and other collections provide ancient evidence--from the interiors and exteriors of the pots themselves--as to how they were formed and constructed, while line drawings illustrate how the potter worked.</p><p><br><strong>Toby Schreiber</strong>, a potter, has contributed articles to <em>Greek Vases in the J. Paul Getty Museum</em> and the <em>J. Paul Getty Museum Journal</em>.<br><br>"This may be the finest and most important book written on Greek vases in the last twenty-five years."--<em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Honor and Slavery</h2><p><p>The "honorable men" who ruled the Old South had a language all their own, one comprised of many apparently outlandish features yet revealing much about the lives of masters and the nature of slavery. When we examine Jefferson Davis's explanation as to why he was wearing women's clothing when caught by Union soldiers, or when we consider the story of Virginian statesman John Randolph, who stood on his doorstep declaring to an unwanted dinner guest that he was "not at home," we see that conveying empirical truths was not the goal of their speech. Kenneth Greenberg so skillfully demonstrates, the language of honor embraced a complex system of phrases, gestures, and behaviors that centered on deep-rooted values: asserting authority and maintaining respect. How these values were encoded in such acts as nose-pulling, outright lying, dueling, and gift-giving is a matter that Greenberg takes up in a fascinating and original way.</p><br><p> The author looks at a range of situations when the words and gestures of honor came into play, and he re-creates the contexts and associations that once made them comprehensible. We understand, for example, the insult a navy lieutenant leveled at President Andrew Jackson when he pulls his nose, once we understand how a gentleman valued his face, especially his nose, as the symbol of his public image. Greenberg probes the lieutenant's motivations by explaining what it meant to perceive oneself as dishonored and how such a perception seemed comparable to being treated as a slave. When John Randolph lavished gifts on his friends and enemies as he calmly faced the prospect of death in a duel with Secretary of State Henry Clay, his generosity had a paternalistic meaning echoed by the master-slave relationship and reflected in the pro-slavery argument. These acts, together with the way a gentleman chose to lend money, drink with strangers, go hunting, and die, all formed a language of control, a vision of what it meant to live as a courageous free man. In reconstructing the language of honor in the Old South, Greenberg reconstructs the world.</p></p><p><p>"A genuinely fresh contribution to our understanding of the culture of the Old South . . .

Kennedy&#39;s 1960 bid for the presidency as the first time a candidate relied extensively on public opinion polls to drive a campaign. Polling has come to define American politics, and is perhaps most clearly embodied in Bill Clinton, the post poll-driven president in history. Melvin G. Holli dismisses this notion, however, and reveals that presidential reliance on public opinion polls dates back to the New Deal Era, when Franklin Roosevelt employed a first-generation Finnish-American named Emil Hurja to conduct polls for this 1932 and 1936 presidential campaigns. Holli shows us how Hurja convinced the Democratic National Committee to allow him to apply the new science of polling FDR&#39;s presidential campaign of 1932. Roosevelt&#39;s triumph at the polls in that year and again in 1936, as well as the spectacular 1934 Democratic mid-term congressional victory was legendary. Holli restores Hurja to his rightful place in American history and politics, showing us that the Washington press corps were right on target when they dubbed Hurja the &#39;Wizard of Washington&#39;.</p><p>MELVIN G.

Responding to images as a journalist, broadcaster, essayist, or critic, requires keen precision and a unique originality. In today's media-saturated environment, the only way to be heard over the din of all the other news reports and commentaries is to write and respond in a manner that is fresh and inviting. <b> </b> MEDIA JOURNAL is a reader containing 40 selections focusing on cultural studies, the media and popular culture. The authors have organized the book by asking readers to do three things: to keep media journals in which they reflect on the uses they make of the voices and images of popular culture, to read and respond to the work of other media critics, and to try their hands at writing media criticism themselves. Readings are drawn from a wide range of writings, and are selected for their liveliness, contemporaneity, and insight. Updated readings better address the diverse media culture of the 1990s. Each reading selection is followed by: "Coming to Terms"--understanding the author in one's own words; "Reading as a Writer"--looking at style and strategy; and "Writing Criticism"--making an author's words and ideas a source for one's own writing. <b> </b> Journalists, writers, cultural historians, critics, philosophers, and anyone interested in popular culture, the media, and cultural studies. </p></p><p></p><h2>KJV/RV Interlinear Black Calfskin RV655:X</h2><p>The Interlinear Bible is really two Bibles in one.

Among the issues Cappelli analyzes are:<br><br> What is the real link between a college degree and a job that enables you to pay off the cost of college, especially in a market that is in constant change?<br> Why it may be a mistake to pursue degrees that will land you the hottest jobs because what is hot today is unlikely to be so by the time you graduate.<br> Why the most expensive colleges may actually be the cheapest because of their ability to graduate students on time.<br> How parents and students can find out what different colleges actually deliver to students and whether it is something that employers really want.<br><br>College is the biggest expense for many families, larger even than the cost of the family home, and one that can bankrupt students and their parents if it works out poorly.

Her dog was left behind; she is devoted to him and the other animals, despite her poverty. Her brother, on the other hand, was not only miserly but cruel to animalsshe had seen him with her own eyes, as children, "trim a hairy caterpillar with a pair of scissors." The widow arrives to find a small shack with all but worthless contents, and a gray parrot called James that shrieks "Not at home!" The money is nowhere to be found. Mrs. Gage feeds James some sugar and talks to him, as her brother used to, "as if he were a rational being." As she returns home from the solicitors she loses her way in the dark and is saved by the light of a huge fireher brother's house. She worries about the bird and tries to save him. Instead, he saves herhe had ignited the fire and now leads her to her brother's hidden money. The story behind this lighthearted tale of heroism, mystery and kindness to animals is that Woolf had contributed this piece to her nephews' family newspaper.

All ages. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 2 Up Woolf wrote this tongue-in-cheek Victorian story of kindness rewarded in response to her young nephews' requests for an article for their family newspaper. Poor old Mrs. Gage inherits a house and 3000 from her miserly brother, but when she arrives at the village to claim it, she finds a dilapidated house and a rude parrot. Since the lawyers don't know where the money is, the penniless woman begins her long trek home. Her way is lit by a house burningher inheritanceand, stunned, she returns, concerned about the well being of the parrot. Later that night, the bird leads her to the buried treasure. Woolf's story sounds as if an older aunt were sitting by the fire spinning the story out towards its moral of the rewards of kindness to animals. The watercolor illustrations by her grandnephew provide glimpses of the blues and greens of the Yorkshire countryside where Woolf lived. While this short story is a good choice for reading aloud to older children, it may be of more interest to adult scholars of Woolf's work for a view of the author at play.

She has been nurturing her love of microbiology since her youth growing up on an Idaho farm where she was first fascinated by tiny creatures she could just barely see swimming in a pond. This interest in the microbial world led to a biology major at Idaho State University, where she worked as a teaching assistant and scientific illustrator for one of her professors. This was the beginning of an avocation that she continues today&#x2015;that of lending her artistic hand to interpretation of scientific concepts. She continued her education at Arizona State University, Occidental College, California Institute of Technology, and California State University. She has taught microbiology and major&#x2019;s biology courses at Pasadena City College for 30 years, during which time she developed new curricula and refined laboratory experiments. She has been an author of, and contributor to, several publications of the William C. Brown Company and McGraw-Hill Publishers since the early 1980s, first illustrating and writing for laboratory manuals and later developing this textbook. She has also served as a coauthor with Kelly Cowan on the first two editions of Microbiology: A Systems Approach. Kathy continues to make microbiology a major focus of her life and is passionate about conveying the significance and practical knowledge of the subject to students, colleagues, family, friends, and practically anyone who shows interest. In addition to her writing and illustration, she keeps current attending conferences and participating in the American Society for Microbiology and its undergraduate educational programs. She is gratified by the many supportive notes and letters she has received over the years from devotees of microbiology and users of her book. She lives in Altadena, California, with husband Dave Bedrosian, and son David. Whenever she can, she visits her family in Idaho. In her spare time, she enjoys photography, reading true crime books, music, crossword puzzles, and playing with her rescued kitties.</p><h2>A Concise History of the Catholic Church, Revised and Expanded Edition</h2><p>This critically acclaimed history covers the events and doctrines that have shaped Catholic thought and action over the past two millennia. A singularly useful reference book, updated and expanded for the student of the 1990&#39;s.</p><p><p><b>THOMAS BOKENKOTTER</b>, the author of the bestselling <i>Church and Revolution</i>, teaches at Xavier University. He is also the pastor of Assumption Church and is active in the social ministry, running a soup kitchen that he founded twenty years ago and a transitional living facility for homeless women and children. He lives in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>Chapter I<br>JESUS<br>The Catholic Church has always claimed Jesus of Nazareth as its founder, and nearly everyone is familiar with the basic facts about this dynamic Jewish preacher and healer who was born around the turn of the first century a.d. (probably between 6 b.c. and a.d. 6) and was crucified by the Romans between a.d. 28 and 30. His early years were spent at Nazareth in Galilee with parents who were of lowly origin. At some point in his early manhood he felt a call to preach the coming of God's kingdom and began to gather huge crowds from the villages and towns in the region northwest of the Lake of Galilee; they were spellbound by his marvelous sermons and extraordinary healings. Well versed in the written and oral traditions of his Jewish religion, he presupposed in his preaching the basic Jewish faith in one God, the Lord of history, God's special covenant with the Jews, and the sacredness of the moral precepts of the Torah or Law, which his people regarded as the revealed will of God. The climax of his ministry came when he entered Jerusalem in triumph, only to be apprehended and crucified by the Romans as a political agitator.<br><br>His early life is wrapped in almost complete obscurity. Our only important sources for his life--the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John--tell us very little about this period; Mark and John pass over it altogether; Matthew and Luke each devote their first two chapters to an account of his infancy, but we can't be sure how much of this is history. It is, in fact, difficult to fit these first chapters of Matthew and Luke into any definite literary category; many scholars regard them as a type of Jewish Midrash--a commentary on Scripture that often used imaginative invention of episodes in order to illustrate biblical themes.<br><br>One indication of their nonhistorical character is the important differences--if not outright contradictions--between Matthew and Luke's accounts. Matthew, for instance, dates the birth of Jesus during Herod's reign--that is, not later than 4 b.c. (the date of Herod's death), while Luke dates it during the period when Quirinius was legate of Syria, which according to the historian Josephus was from a.d. 6 to 9. Moreover, the two evangelists disagree in the names they list in the genealogy they attribute to Jesus. The theological insight they intend to convey, however, is clear: Jesus, the son of David and Son of God, was the long-awaited Messiah who came to bring salvation to all--both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>When we come to the so-called public life of Jesus, which begins with his baptism by John at the River Jordan, we must admit that we do not have the kind of biographical details that readers look for today, such as descriptions of his physical appearance and personal habits, some idea of his psychological development, or the influences that shaped his personality.<br><br>But there is no need for skepticism. More than a century of rigorous critical analysis of the New Testament has in no way disproven the constant belief of Christians that their Scriptures are based on the actual words and deeds of a unique historical personage.<br><br>The Gospels, as we've said, constitute--practically speaking--our only source of historical facts about Jesus, and they were written from forty to seventy years after his death. Their authors drew on an oral tradition that disseminated stories about the deeds and words of Jesus in the form of sermons and catechetical and liturgical material. Mark, we believe, was the first to cast this oral tradition in the form of a Gospel--a unique literary genre which he invented. His Gospel appeared shortly before the fall of Jerusalem, which occurred in the year 70. Some ten years later, Matthew and Luke each produced a Gospel by using Mark's work plus a collection of the words of Jesus (often referred to by scholars as Q, for Quelle, German for "source") and also some special material that each evangelist had at hand. Finally, at the turn of the century, the author known as John produced the fourth Gospel, which differs considerably from the other three in its portrait of Jesus.<br><br>The Gospels were not meant to be a historical or biographical account of Jesus. They were written to convert unbelievers to faith in Jesus as the Messiah of God, risen and living now in his church and coming again to judge all men. Their authors did not deliberately invent or falsify facts about Jesus, but they were not primarily concerned with historical accuracy. They readily included material drawn from the Christian communities' experience of the risen Jesus. Words, for instance, were put in the mouth of Jesus and stories were told about him which, though not historical in the strict sense, nevertheless, in the minds of the evangelists, fittingly expressed the real meaning and intent of Jesus as faith had come to perceive him. For this reason, scholars have come to make a distinction between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith.<br><br>To find the Jesus of history, we have to sift through the material presented in the Gospels and try to determine by internal evidence what Jesus actually did and said as distinguished from what represents later interpretation. As a general rule, scholars hold that whatever cannot be deduced or explained from the Judaism of Jesus' time or from primitive Christianity should be ascribed to the Jesus of history. What this means specifically is that while historical criticism makes it impossible to reconstruct a biography of Jesus in the ordinary sense, it does permit us to recover a considerable amount of authentic Jesus material. In fact, by adhering to the historical critical method we can determine "the typical basic features and outlines of Jesus' proclamation, behavior, and fate."<br><br>All attempts to trace the origin of Jesus' call to his divine mission are hindered by the fragmentary nature of the records. But there is good reason to suppose that his baptism by John was decisive in this regard. At least all our accounts agree that at his baptism "the Spirit descended on him"--a biblical phrase denoting the call of someone to be God's messenger.<br><br>The message that Jesus proclaimed was simple in formula yet inexhaustible: "The kingdom of God is at hand, repent!" Matthew puts the same words on the lips of John, but there is no doubt that he regarded John as only the herald of Jesus, through whose ministry God actually broke into human history in an absolutely unprecedented and definitive way.<br><br>Some scholars argue that Jesus announced this incursion of God into history as a purely future thing involving a cosmic catastrophe and the end of the world. However, there is now growing agreement that there is both a present and a future reference in Jesus' teaching: The reign of God already at work in his ministry was moving toward a consummation in the future. Some of his parables--like the one about the prodigal son who was welcomed back with love by the father whose bounty he had wasted--emphasize the point that God with fantastic goodness and generosity was already extending mercy to sinners. And when Jesus ate and drank with publicans and harlots, the meaning he intended was clear: Salvation is offered now to all, a gift in no way dependent on one's prior righteousness.<br><br>It is thus clear, as the Jewish scholar David Flusser says, that Jesus is the "only Jew known to us from ancient times" who proclaimed that the "new age of salvation had already begun." On the other hand, there is a strong tension in Jesus' proclamation between the present salvific action of God and its fulfillment in the future. God would intervene to establish something radically new; it would be a cataclysm bringing an end to all earthly hopes and schemes. So Jesus spoke in terms of extreme urgency about the need to repent and to be ready for the inbreaking of God into history.<br><br>Jesus not only preached the good news of the kingdom, he also gathered his followers into a fellowship. They often took their meals together, celebrating joyfully their new covenant with God while they anticipated the glorious banquet to come in the kingdom of heaven. He called them the light of the world, the city of God, the salt of the earth. They were a family whose common devotion to God's will united them far more intensely than any bonds of flesh and blood.<br><br>In some ways all of this resembled other spiritual movements of his day. Another Jewish group--the Essenes, for instance--had, as the Dead Sea Scrolls show, the same sense of joy at the imminent advent of God's kingdom. They too practiced renunciation of personal possessions and their leader too advocated celibacy. And from them Jesus may have derived his doctrine of not resisting evildoers. But they held to a sharp separation from the common herd, and many of them secluded themselves in monasteries near the Dead Sea. Jesus, on the other hand, opposed any form of exclusivism; it would have been at odds with his main doctrine of the boundless nature of God's offer of grace. So he deliberately sought out the social outcasts and even showed them special signs of his favor.<br><br>The members of Jesus' kingdom felt a most intimate relationship with God, whom they loved to call Father. And he taught them to live sincerely as God's children. Though a tiny group, poor and despised, they had the greatest of conceivable treasures--the absolute assurance of salvation, a salvation not dependent on their own achievements but on the unlimited goodness of God. Nor must they worry about daily necessities; their heavenly Father's providence, which reached even to the tiniest sparrow, would surely not desert them. Not that they would be spared any of the manifold forms of suffering and anguish that life brings to everyone. But there was no need for them to comprehend the unfathomable mystery of evil; enough to know that suffering when accepted brings one closer to God, while death itself is only the prelude to union with him.<br><br>Life in God's kingdom inaugurated by Jesus found its purest expression in prayer, and J...</p><h2>Dictionnaire Cambridge Klett Poche Fran�ais-Anglais/English-French (English and French Edition)</h2><p>This is a fully bilingual dictionary of English and French for intermediate learners.

Topics include finding a project, breaking down a script, creating a production board, casting, budgeting, scouting locations, scheduling, dealing with actors, establishing set protocol, marketing, and many others. Throughout, real-life examples vividly illustrate the subject at hand.

Paul Getty Museum</h2><p>Carleton E. Watkins (1829-1916) is best remembered for his large-format photographs of the American West, especially those taken in Yosemite. This new volume, the latest in the popular <em>In Focus</em> series, is devoted to some of his smaller and unusually shaped works, including stereographs, albumen prints, and cabinet and boudoir cards--most of which have never before been published.<br><br> The J. Paul Getty Museum's collection of Watkins's photographs consists of 1464 pictures, making him the best-represented nineteenth-century photographer in the collection. Presented here are more than fifty of these photographs, along with commentary on each image by Peter Palmquist. The book also offers a chronological overview of the artist's life and an edited transcript of a colloquium on his career.</p><p>Victorian landscape photographer Carleton Watkins (1829-1916) described his lifelong project in simple terms: to find "the best spot with the best view." However, this self-trained but precocious man, who seemed to delight in giving away much of the work he produced, is now considered one of the most gifted American photographers of the 19th century. Perhaps best known for his pictures of the then newly discovered scenic wonder Yosemite, Watkins made thousands of remarkable, sophisticated, and historically important images that provide an unparalleled visual record of the western United States. In his spectacular depictions of the West Coast's natural resources and the industrial outposts nested within them by way of the California Gold Rush and the Central and Southern Pacific Railroads, Watkins captured the sense of adventure and expansionist enthusiasm of the mid-1800s American imagination. <p> In the photo <i>Sugar Loaf Islands, Farallons</i>, the combination of grand scale and lush detail draws the viewer into an arresting image in which a single jagged rock emerges from a smoky mist. Only upon closer inspection does one discover that the shiny pebbles at its base are actually about a hundred glistening seals who loll along the beach of a mammoth island. Throughout his 50-year career, Watkins traveled tirelessly under adverse conditions to remote sites, often by mule. He carried cumbersome equipment, including his giant camera, which was custom-made by a cabinetmaker. And he secured his hard-earned images on fragile glass-plate negatives. Watkins's adventuring laid the groundwork for his pioneering in the nascent art and technique of photography. His work commanded wonder and respect from large audiences on both coasts, and the sheer beauty of his pictures helped set a national policy of scenic conservation that preceded the present system of national parks. </p><p> <i>Carleton Watkins: The Art of Perception</i> is a companion volume to the first large-scale exhibition to look at this photographer's work from a critical, art-historical perspective. The show originates at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., through the year 2000. Produced using state-of-the-art tritone printing, this catalog includes 125 of Watkins's best images--stereo cards and multipart panoramic works among them. Accompanying the photographs are compelling and informative essays by Douglas Nickel, associate curator of photography at SFMOMA, and Maria Morris Hambourg, curator in charge of the Department of Photographs at the Met, as well as Peter E. Palmquist's notes on the plates, a list of selected references, and a chronology. <i>--A.C. Smith</i></p>Carleton Watkins (1829-1916) was perhaps the greatest American landscape photographer of the 19th century. His groundbreaking images of Yosemite, the Columbia River, and other natural wonders captured the grandeur of the American West for audiences around the world-and set an aesthetic standard rivaled only in the work of Ansel Adams many years later. This companion volume to a major traveling exhibition is the most beautiful book on Watkins&#39; work ever published. Produced using state-of-the-art tritone printing, it showcases 105 of the photographer&#39;s exquisitely composed images, including four gatefolds presenting Watkins&#39; astonishing panoramic photographs. The texts are informed by substantial new research into Watkins&#39; life and work, offering a fresh perspective on his achievement. 105 photographs in tritone and 20 in duotone, 4 gatefolds, 1011/2 x 1111/2&#34; Douglas R.

A foundation of understanding normal alignment is presented, using new nomenclature that is easy to remember and can even be derived without memorization. The work offers detailed information on deformities and malalignment, radiographic assessment, mechanical and anatomic axis planning, osteotomies, and hardware considerations. The part dealing with planning is further facilitated via an exercise workbook and an animated CD-ROM which is available separately. The methods taught are simple and intuitive.</p><p><p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"Dror Paley has written a remarkable book that, perhaps for the first time, permits complete fulfillment of Andry's standard for alignment in the correction of complex limb deformities... just as a NASA lunar flight manual provides the terms needed to explore new worlds, so too will Paley's Principles of Deformity Correction offer the dedicated reader new perspectives on lower limb deformities." (Journal of Bone &amp; Joint Surgery)</p> <p>"Dror Paley has written a remarkable book ... . Principles of Deformity Correction evolved from a course taught by Paley and his coworkers in Baltimore. The book, which deals exclusively with lower limb deformities, is divided into two parts. The first ten chapters present a step-by-step technique for deformity analysis ... . The second part of the book describes various surgical techniques designed to correct the deformities once they have been fully analyzed." (Stuart A.

A woman at the precipice of adulthood often finds herself with more questions than answers, with more disenchantment than direction. How is she supposed to &#x201c;lean in&#x201d; to a successful career while also building deeply meaningful relationships? How can she care for the community around her while simultaneously developing a global mindset and changing the world? How can she be all that she is destined to be without feeling paralyzed by the pressure of so many prospects?</p><p>Allison Trowbridge knows this dilemma well. She remembers stepping into her twenties and wishing for a mentor to guide her through this dizzying season of life. In <em>Twenty-Two</em>, she becomes the mentor she was looking for. Drawing from her own experience and from the wisdom of others, she offers advice and counsel in a series of personal letters to &#x201c;Ashley,&#x201d; a fictional college student looking for mentorship from someone one step ahead in life.</p><p>Over the course of twenty-two letters, Trowbridge addresses a wide range of practical issues and ties them to larger concerns such as identity, loss, social impact as a lifestyle, wisdom in the ordinary moments, and the profound way God&#x2019;s work is realized in how we live every day. Subtly weaving in today&#x2019;s pressing social concerns&#x2014;from poverty in our neighborhoods to human trafficking across the globe&#x2014;<em>Twenty-Two</em> will inspire a greater sense of mission and a passion to live more fully as young women embark on their own remarkable journeys.</p></p><p><p>Allison Trowbridge<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a writer, speaker, and social entrepreneur who is passionate about empowering millennial women to impact their world.

At a time when children&#39;s stories were formal, moral and didactic, Hans Christian Andersen revolutionized the genre, giving an anarchic twist to traditional folklore and creating a huge number of utterly original stories that sprang directly from his imagination. From the exuberant early stories such as &#34;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&#34;, though poignant masterpieces such as &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; and &#34;The Ugly Duckling&#34;, to the darker, more subversive later tales written for adults, the stories included here are endlessly experimental, both humorous and irreverent, sorrowful and strange. This book - beautifully illustrated with a selection of Andersen&#39;s amazing paper cut-outs - will bring these magical tales to life for readers of any age.</p><p>Hans Christian Andersen (1805-75) was born in Odense, Denmark, the son of a poor shoemaker and a washerwoman. As a young teenager, he became quite well known in Odense as a reciter of drama, and as a singer. When he was fourteen, he set off for the capital, Copenhagen, determined to become a national success on the stage. He failed miserably, but made some influential friends in the capital, who got him into school to remedy his lack of proper education. He hated school: aged seventeen, he was in a class of twelve-year-olds and was constantly mocked by them and by the teachers. In 1829 his first book - an account of a walking trip - was published. After that, books came out at regular intervals. At first, he considered his adult books more important than his fantasies. In later life, however, he began to see that these apparently trivial stories could vividly portray constant features of human life and character, in a charming manner. There were two consequences of this. First, he stopped regarding his stories as trifles written solely for children; second, he began to write more original stories, rather than retelling traditional tales. He once said that ideas for stories &#39;lie in my mind like seeds and only need the kiss of a sunbeam or a drop of malice to flower&#39;. He would often thinly disguise people he liked or disliked as characters in his stories: a woman who failed to return his love becomes the foolish prince in &#39;The Little Mermaid&#39;; his own ugliness and humiliation, or his father&#39;s daydream of being descended from a rich and powerful family, are reflected in &#39;The Ugly Duckling&#39;. Hans Andersen&#39;s stories began to be translated into English as early as 1846. Since then, numerous editions, and more recently Hollywood songs and a Disney cartoon, have helped to ensure the continuing popularity of the stories in the English-speaking world.</p><h2>Walden and Civil Disobedience (Word Cloud Classics)</h2><p>&#x201c;If a plant cannot live according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.&#x201d;--Henry David Thoreau, <i>Civil Disobedience</i><br> <br>&nbsp;<br><br>The oft-quoted transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau is best known for two works: <i>Walden</i> and <i>Civil Disobedience</i>. <i>Walden</i>, first published in 1854, documents the time Thoreau spent living with nature in a hand-built cabin in the woods near Walden Pond in Massachusetts. A minor work in its own time, <i>Walden</i> burgeoned in popularity during the counter culture movement of the 1960s. <i>Civil Disobedience</i> is thought to have originated after Thoreau spent a night in jail for refusing to pay taxes to a government with whose policies he did not agree. Assigning greater importance to the conscience of the individual than the governing law, <i>Civil Disobedience</i> is an internationally admired work that is known to have influenced writer Leo Tolstoy and political activist Mahatma Gandhi, and many members of the American Civil Rights Movement. Now available together in one chic and affordable edition as part of the Word Cloud Classics series, <i>Walden and Civil Disobedience</i> makes an attractive addition to any library. <br> <br>&nbsp;</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In 1845 Henry David Thoreau left his pencil-manufacturing business and began building a cabin on the shore of Walden Pond near Concord, Massachusetts. This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind. Elegant, witty, and quietly searching, Walden remains the most persuasive American argument for simplicity of life clarity of conscience.<br><br>For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books.

As Kadarkay makes clear in this comprehensive biography, Lukacs's revolutionary career deviated sharply from his interests as a student. Before World War I, he acquired a reputation as a prodigy in literature and philosophy. Max Weber thought highly of him. His utopian fascination found its definitive outlet with the onset of Bolshevism. Embracing Leninism, he presented his vision of the vanguard party in History and Class-Consciousness (1923). Kadarkay traces in detail Lukacs's political activities and his work as a literary scholar, emphasizing his personal side more than his ideas. To Kadarkay, Lukacs's complex psychology is fascinating. Those not in the grip of Lukacs's personality may find the book overly detailed. The product of much labor and devotion, it will probably become the standard biography.<br><i>- David Gordon, Bowling Green State Univ., Ohio</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Windows 10 All-In-One For Dummies</h2><p><b>The most comprehensive guide to Windows 10, updated with the latest enhancements</b> <p>If you're new to Windows 10 and want an authoritative and accessible guide to the basics of the widely used operating system, <i>Windows 10 All-in-One For Dummies</i> is the book for you.

But how do drugs have their effect in the human body? How are new drugs discovered and designed to be as effective as possible? An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry offers an engaging insight into the one field of chemistry that arguably has the greatest impact on our quality of life than any other.<br> <br> Newly structured into four parts, the book opens in Part A with an introduction to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamics considers the types of molecular targets used by drugs, the interactions which are involved when a drug meets that target, and the consequences of those interactions. Pharmacokinetics considers the issues involved in a drug reaching its target in the first place. Part B goes on to examine the general principles and strategies involved in discovering and designing new drugs and developing them for the marketplace, while Part C looks at particular 'tools of the trade' which are invaluable in those processes.

Robinson has become a national icon, his name a virtual synonym for pathbreaker. Indeed, much has transpired between this young African-American's first bold strides around the baseball diamonds of a segregated America and General Manager Bob Watson's pride in assembling 1996 World Champion New York Yankees. Recognizing this monumental event in America's continuing struggle for integration, Jules Tygiel has expanded his highly acclaimed <em>Baseball's Great Experiment</em>. In a new afterword, he addresses the mythology surrounding Robinson's achievements, his overall effect on baseball and other sports, and the enduring legacy Robinson has left for African Americans and American society.<br> In this gripping account of one of the most important steps in the history of American desegregation, Tygiel tells the story of Jackie Robinson's crossing of baseball's color line. Examining the social and historical context of Robinson's introduction into white organized baseball, both on and off the field, Tygiel also tells the often neglected stories of other African-American players--such as Satchel Paige, Roy Campanella, Willie Mays, and Hank Aaron--who helped transform our national pastime into an integrated game. Drawing on dozens of interviews with players and front office executives, contemporary newspaper accounts, and personal papers, Tygiel provides the most telling and insightful account of Jackie Robinson's influence on American baseball and society.</p><p><br><strong>Jules Tygiel</strong>, a native of Brooklyn, is Professor of History at San Francisco State University and founder of the Pacific Ghost League.

But buying a home is one of life&#x2019;s most stressful, emotionally fraught activities, and it&#x2019;s easy to see why many home buyers fail to anticipate the kinds of exasperating and expensive problems that can crop up after closing. </p> <p> Written by bestselling real estate author (more than 1 million books sold) Robert Irwin, <i>Home Buyer's Checklist</i> levels the playing field by equipping home buyers with a comprehensive list of questions pertaining to all the physical aspects of a house that may not be covered in an official inspection. From basement to attic, pantry to lawn, Bob walks readers through every room, nook, cranny, closet and keep, asking important questions about windows, screens, doors and door frames, fireplaces, light fixtures, moldings, and much, much more. And, drawing upon his many years of experience in the business, he provides pointers on how to deal with each problem, including information on how much it will cost to fix, how to estimate its short- and long-term consequences, how it should impact on the negotiating process, and more. </p></p><p><p>America's Number One Real Estate Expert gives you the tools you need to uncover the REAL story behind any house.</p> <p>Surprises are only fun if it's your birthday, not after you make an offer or buy a home and "SURPRISE"--it needs a lot more work than you thought.

Deliberately written in a humorous and easily understood style, this will be an invaluable resource for parents and direct care service providers. ABA is a technically precise discipline, where a misunderstanding of a term can lead to a misapplied technique. Behaviorspeak will give readers the tools necessary to understand articles in professional journals, presentations, and books.</p><p>It reads in the foreword to Behaviorspeak, "without a familiarity with some of the technical terms, understanding some practitioners of ABA is about as easy as trying to lip-read a muppet." Behaviorspeak is the answer. A parent or professional can consult this work whenever they come across a term that is not immediately understood. ABA is a precise discipline, and an understanding of the terms is the first step in understanding the science. <p>"I have used Behaviorspeak as a reference several times since you sent it to me. Often, I read information on the internet, or even hear a teacher use a term, and I'll think "wait, that's not right," or "what does THAT mean?" Then I doubt my own knowledge and understanding of terms commonly used in ABA. Behaviorspeak is great for clarification, as well as inspiration for program and procedural ideas. I remember when I first joined autism groups on the internet, it took a few months before I truly understood the language parents and professionals were speaking. Behaviorspeak would have saved me a lot of time and confusion! This glossary is an empowering resource." </p><p>Jennica Valasquez,Parent</p>"In writing Behaviorspeak, Newman and his colleagues, Reeve, Reeve, and Ryan have provided the behavior analytic community a useful tool, a glossary of behavioral terms for people who are not behavior analysts, especially the parents of children labeled as being with autism. Their glossary is technically accurate, comprehensive, readable, and illustrated with example of interest to those who are involved with applied behavior analysis, as clients, family members, lay practitioners, students, and even professional behavior analysts. Their glossary is also up to date; for example, it's the only glossary I know of that defines Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BCBA); it also implies the significance of BCBA for those looking for behavior analytic help. And being a glossary of the 21st century, it contains the addresses of useful websites. I think this book is a must for consumers and providers of applied behavior analysis." <p>Richard W. Malott, PhD, BCBA Behavior Analysis Program, Department of Psychology, Western Michigan University</p></p><h2>Forests and French Sea Power, 1660-1789 (Heritage)</h2><p><p>By choosing to concentrate upon discovering what forest resources were available to the French navy during the <em>ancien r�gime</em> and what use it was able to make of them, Mr. Bamford has not only provided the first monograph on that subject in the English language, but has gone far toward explaining why France was the loser in the long duel with England for the control of commerce and the extension of empire.</p> <br><p>Two years of research in the Archives Nationales and in the Archives de la Marine in Paris, Toulon, and Rochefort enabled him to draw on contemporary sources of information of which little, if any, use has been made before, and a further year of research in the libraries of New York City, particularly in the rich Proudfit Naval Collection, also yielded new material. It is Mr. Bamford's achievement to have handled this vast store of primary sources with such skill and judgement that the reader, by turning over letters from disgruntled forest proprietors, reports from harassed <em>ma�tres</em> on the trickery and recalcitrance of the peasants, instructions from the top echelon of the navy to inspectors in the forests, and a variety bills, receipts, and memoranda, is given at first hand an appreciation of the difficulties faced by the navy in trying to obtain timber and masts of the choice quality required for building ships-of-the-line. The navy had to compete with the merchant marine and with industrial and private users of fuel for supplies that were continually being depleted by mismanagement and by the conversion of forests to arable land. Measures, superficially admirable, for conserving the forests are found on closer examination to be at once over-precise and not properly enforced. Transport, even in a country so abundantly supplied with navigable rivers as France, was expensive and difficult.</p> <br><p>Not only historians, but scholars in the field of forestry, economics, geography, agriculture, and transport will find this book illuminating.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Paul Bamford</strong> (1921 - 2007) taught at several colleges and universities and came to the University of Minnesota in 1958. He remained an active member of the history faculty until his retirement in 1991.</p></p><h2>Novel of Ferrara</h2><p>Bassani&#39;s six classic books, collected for the first time in English as the epic masterwork they were intended to be. Set in the northern Italian town of Ferrara before, during, and after the Second World War, The Novel of Ferrara brings together Bassani&#39;s six classic books, fully revised as a single volume by the author at the end of his life: Within the Walls, The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, Behind the Door, The Heron and The Smell of Hay. These interlocking stories present a fully rounded world of unforgettable characters, memorializing not only the Ferrarese people, but the city itself, which assumes a character and a voice deeply inflected by the Jewish community to which the narrator belongs.&#39;Exquisite . . . from his boyhood Ferrara and the families he knew, Bassani has carved out a corner of Italy that rises above regionalism with fiction that can stand alongside the most lingering written in Europe to day&#39; The New York Times</p><p></p><h2>Agnes Martin</h2><p><p><b>New discourse on four decades of painting by one of the 20th century&#x2019;s most influential artists</b><br><br> Gorgeously quiet in color and composition, Agnes Martin&#x2019;s paintings have a distinctive grace that sets them apart from those of the Abstract Expressionists of her day and the Minimalist artists she inspired. Martin attributed her grid-based works to metaphysical motivations, lending a serene complexity to her oeuvre that has defied any easy categorization. Perhaps for this reason, critical and scholarly analysis of her paintings has been scarce&#x2014;until now. This important new anthology brings together the most current scholarship on Martin&#x2019;s paintings by twelve multidisciplinary essayists who consider various aspects of the artist&#x2019;s four-decade career.</p><p>Organized by Dia Art Foundation, whose extensive holdings of Martin&#x2019;s paintings and ambitions to support in-depth research on the works are unparalleled, the publication brings renewed focus and energy to Martin&#x2019;s career and her contributions to the art historical narrative.</p></p><p><p><b>Lynne Cooke</b> is curator at Dia Art Foundation and chief curator at the Centro de Arte Reina Sof�a, Madrid. </p>"This volume is an irresistible summons to readers to turn their backs on the world, and follow the artist into her work."&#x2014;Nancy Campbell, <i><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></i><br></p><h2>Financial Institutions, Markets, and Money</h2><p>Book is barely used.</p><p></p><h2>Learn to Program, Second Edition (The Facets of Ruby Series)</h2><p><p><b>Printed in full color.</b><br><br>For this new edition of the best-selling <i>Learn to Program</i>, Chris Pine has taken a good thing and made it even better.

Is the era of American leadership over? Has the West begun a decline into a new Dark Age? Does American civilization deserve to survive? These are the unnerving questions raised by the Great Crash of 2009. This book presents a radically new answer, insisting that global society has only begun to realize its full potential. Author HowardBloom argues that there&#39;s a hidden mandate beneath the surface of capitalism: &#34;It&#39;s struggling to whisper and rumble its message to you and me. That hidden imperative can lift us from economic crisis, can make us a leader in the next-generation economy, and can dramatically upgrade our ability to empower our fellow human beings.&#34; Bloom sees crisis as opportunity, opportunity for the whole human race.In more than eighty short, fast chapters, insights appear suddenly, like the quick bursts of flashbulbs, taking the reader on a sweeping tour of human history, from the Stone Age to the present. Every chapter conveys a radically new way to see the astonishing mechanism we call &#34;Western Civilization.&#34; Bloom marvels at how humans have turned toxic waste into food and fuel, trash into treasure, and garbage into gold. He shows how we&#39;ve produced material miracles based on immaterial things-passion, persistence, and fantasy. He shows that what many regard as the end is just the beginning. The beginning of something you&#39;ve never before imagined. The author explains why the secret to capitalism&#39;s next great leap does not lie in new financial tricks, but in tapping things right under our noses in radically new ways-that is, tapping our imagination, our desire to feel useful, our desire to help others, and our desire to be recognized for contributing to the welfare of humanity. The key to next-generation capitalism lies in a big-picture view that&#39;s utterly unlike anything you&#39;ve previously perceived. A big-picture view that will startle you. A big-picture view with which you can ignite the world, get a new handle on your life, and help transform society. This brilliant, inspirational work of daring ideas and breathtaking research offers more than hope. It offers unseen levels of understanding. Understanding that can literally redefine what it means to be a human being.</p><p><b>Howard Bloom</b> has been called "the Einstein, Newton, Darwin, and Freud of the twenty-first century" and "the next Stephen Hawking." He is the author of two acclaimed books, <i>The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition into the Forces of History </i>and <i>Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century</i>. Those books have won praise from the <i>New Yorker</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, the <i>Boston Globe, Wired, Foreign Affairs</i>, and numerous other publications. A recent visiting scholar at New York University, Bloom is the founder of the International Paleopsychology Project, founder of the Space Development Steering Committee (a group that includes Buzz Aldrin and Edgar Mitchell) and founding board member of the Epic of Evolution Society. He has appeared on <i>Good Morning America</i>, the <i>CBS Morning News, CBS Nightwatch</i>, the BBC, and over one hundred other media outlets."Howard Bloom is an exceptional scientific writer. Though he does not have the variety of university degrees behind which historians, anthropologists and sociologists usually hide, he demonstrates two of the most basic qualities of the scientific spirit in the highest degree. He pushes himself to discover the mistakes hidden in things that are considered obvious truths. And to do it he uses the greatest range of scientific insights available, no matter what disciplinary barriers separate them. For that, he puts to work a creative imagination far outside the ordinary, the kind that belongs to the great discoverers. He apparently joins all that to an exceptional capacity for work, the kind without which nothing solid can be laid in place." -- Les Automates Intelligents, October 29, 2009<br><br>"It's an extraordinary book, exhilaratingly-written and masterfully-researched. <b>I couldn't put it down</b>." --<b>James Burke</b>, creator and host of seven BBC TV series, including <i>Connections</i>.<br><p>"<b>Brilliant and powerful</b>." --<b>Edgar Mitchell</b>, sixth man to walk on the Moon, pilot of Apollo 14's Lunar Module, and founder of The Institute of Noetic Sciences<br></p><p>"<b>Impressive and stimulating</b>.

Bloom is a thinker of the order of Herbert Spencer or Henri Bergson--he tries to see the whole picture from the origin of the universe through the origin of life to the origins of humanity and the continuity of the creativity of the cosmos in our personal and social behavior. His insights along the way are mind-churning: his portrayal of Plato's real genius as a marketer is brilliant. The bacteria who poisoned their environment and thus moved evolution upward...what a metaphor. Columbus' greatest skill was marketing not navigation, the role of tea rituals, and the tale of soap, all are wonderful. I've been writing about Max Weber and 'the spirit of capitalism' and it makes me even more aware of the brilliance of Bloom's argument about what is in the beast and how it can be tapped: capitalism does not just emerge from the Protestant ethic but from the nature of the human animal and its cosmic inheritance. Let's hope this side of the beast can win out over its parochial and narrow other self that longs for the safety of the tribe. But about the West at its best, he's right: Capitalism = Service.

Was it too weak to carry through the Revolution? To what extent was the purchase of arms and materials from outside sources dependent upon the appearance of a constitutional government inside Republican Spain? What chances had an improvised army of guerrillas against a trained fighting force? In seeking to solve these problems, the anarchists and revolutionary syndicalists were confronted with other questions. Could they collaborate with political parties and reformist unions? Should the revolutionary impetus of the first days of resistance be halted in the interests of the struggle against Franco or be allowed to develop as far as the workers were able to take it? Was the situation such that the social revolution could triumph and, if not, what was to be the role of the revolutionary workers? Originally written as a series of weekly articles in the 1950s and expanded, republished, and translated over the years, Vernon Richards&#x2019;s analysis remains essential reading for all those interested in revolutionary praxis.</p><p>Across seven decades, <b>Vernon Richards</b> maintained an anarchist presence in British publishing.

Douglas Fairbanks (1883-1939) was one of the first film superstars, a screenwriter, a major independent producer during the early studio era, a cofounder of United Artists, a founder and the first president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and much more. The optimism, energy, and huge success during the 1920s of his best-remembered films <i>The Mark of Zorro, Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood, The Thief of Bagdad, </i>and <i>The Black Pirate </i>made Fairbanks a popular hero throughout the world and showcased his talents as a creative producer whose work set the standard for excellence. <br><br><i>Douglas Fairbanks </i>takes the full measure of Fairbanks's remarkable life. Jeffrey Vance, who had complete access to the star's personal and professional papers and scrapbooks, also incorporates 237 photographs, some unseen for more than seventy-five years. Extensively researched, engagingly written, and sumptuously designed, the book goes behind Fairbanks's public persona to thoroughly explore his art and his far-reaching influence. <br><br><i>Copub: Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences </i></p><p>"The heedless ambition of youth. The triumphs of maturity, redefining our ideas of fame, fortune and international celebrity. The sad aimlessness of the aging male, stripped of his powers over his formerly adoring audience. It is the archetypal Hollywood story, maybe the archetypal American story. And Jeffrey Vance tells it with verve and compassion and admirable compression in his handsomely illustrated biography of Douglas Fairbanks. It is a book that restores his subject to his rightful place as the American movies' founding Big Brother&#x2015;shrewd, playful, flawed and endlessly fascinating."&#x2015;Richard Schickel<br><br>"Over the years I have had an interest in Douglas Fairbanks' life and films before reading Jeffrey Vance's book. I was delighted to find that the research was admirable, the detail abundant, and the style devoid of pretense and heavy-handed scholarship. The book reads gracefully with a wonderful sense of 'and then what happened?' And a great deal does happen to the inimitable Doug along the way. His cinema world of high adventure, storybook romance, cloak and sword derring-do, and dazzling acrobatics against spectacular settings are all here in the text and in the abundance of extraordinary photos&#x2015;many quite rare.

In this major contribution to the debate over the role gender plays in the scientific enterprise, Sandra Harding pursues that question, challenging the intellectual and social foundations of scientific thought.</p><p>Harding provides the first comprehensive and critical survey of the feminist science critiques, and examines inquiries into the androcentricism that has endured since the birth of modern science. Harding critiques three epistemological approaches: feminist empiricism, which identifies only bad science as the problem; the feminist standpoint, which holds that women's social experience provides a unique starting point for discovering masculine bias in science; and feminist postmodernism, which disputes the most basic scientific assumptions. She points out the tensions among these stances and the inadequate concepts that inform their analyses, yet maintains that the critical discourse they foster is vital to the quest for a science informed by emancipatory morals and politics.</p></p><p><p>Sandra Harding is Professor of Social Sciences and Comparative Education at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Finding the neat polarities of tradition and modernity, colonial and postcolonial, no longer sufficient for interpreting the globalized present, she turns elsewhere to make her central argument: that aesthetic education is the last available instrument for implementing global justice and democracy.</p><p>Spivak&#x2019;s unwillingness to sacrifice the ethical in the name of the aesthetic, or to sacrifice the aesthetic in grappling with the political, makes her task formidable. As she wrestles with these fraught relationships, she rewrites Friedrich Schiller&#x2019;s concept of play as double bind, reading Gregory Bateson with Gramsci as she negotiates Immanuel Kant, while in dialogue with her teacher Paul de Man. Among the concerns Spivak addresses is this: Are we ready to forfeit the wealth of the world&#x2019;s languages in the name of global communication? &#x201c;Even a good globalization (the failed dream of socialism) requires the uniformity which the diversity of mother-tongues must challenge,&#x201d; Spivak writes. &#x201c;The tower of Babel is our refuge.&#x201d;</p><p>In essays on theory, translation, Marxism, gender, and world literature, and on writers such as Assia Djebar, J. M. Coetzee, and Rabindranath Tagore, Spivak argues for the social urgency of the humanities and renews the case for literary studies, imprisoned in the corporate university. &#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; she writes, &#x201c;the literary can still do something.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak is University Professor at Columbia University and a trainer of elementary school teachers in West Bengal.Spivak remains an indispensable leader and guide in the exhilarating conceptual adventure&#x2015;the trip&#x2015;which, since the late sixties, we've called theory. <i>Aesthetic Education</i> presents us with lessons that she has learnt on the way&#x2015;difficult, defiant, sober lessons for these unpromising times. They demand our attention. (Simon During, University of Queensland)<br><br>This captivating collection of lectures delivered over the course of a quarter century asks us to attend to the profoundly democratic possibilities of the imagination. Aesthetic education empowers us to apprehend and negotiate what Spivak calls the "double bind at the heart of democracy." At a time when the humanities are expected to genuflect before the sciences and privatization and professionalization displace knowledge, Spivak urges us not only to stand tall but to insist that ethical solidarities are only possible through the rigorous training of the imagination. (Angela Y. Davis, University of California, Santa Cruz)<br><br>[A] rewarding series of meditations on the possibility of reading, learning, and teaching that would encourage the full flowering of cultural, sexual, and linguistic diversity and resist the homogenizing force of globalization...The gathered texts are a testament to a fundamental faith in the power of literature that is never less than inspiring. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2011-11-11)<br><br>Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's latest collection of essays offers a timely reminder of what the real and powerful ends of education might be...[The essays] cover the breadth of an extraordinary intellectual career...The essays, for all their diversity, have the quality of a cumulative, long retrospection, a slow-burning consideration of what it means to teach, how faultily we do it and how we might do better by those who most want to learn and have least opportunity...It is, though, Spivak's assertion, after Schiller, that an aesthetic education remains the strongest resource available for the cause of global justice and democracy. The homogenizing and pacifying effects of globalization, which Spivak so routinely lambasts, here, she argues, can never extend "to the sensory equipment of the experiencing being." And here she has never sounded more persuasive, identifying in arts education the evocation of a phenomenology of feeling and the engendering of critical thinking that are posited beyond the logic of capital. (Shahidha Bari <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2012-04-06)<br><br><b>Spivak</b> is one of the most creative and influential scholars of the humanities of the past four decades; this volume shows the range and variety of her interests in topics ranging from Jacques Derrida, postcolonial studies, women in the Global South, migration in a global (arguably 'planetary') era, translation, and aesthetic education...She brings a profound knowledge of literary and cultural theory to her studies of 'culture on the run, the vanishing present.' Some of the essays here are classics, others will become so. (K.

Written in 1851 as a money-maker for the struggling Hawthorne, <em>A Wonder Book</em> has become a favorite for generations of children everywhere. Hawthorne's mastery of adventure and his command of narrative and character open a child's mind to the wondrous landscapes of ancient mythology in stories such as "The Gorgon's Head" and "The Three Golden Apples." Oxford has created a beautiful and memorable edition of this classic children's text with illustrations by famed book artist Walter Crane, whose full-color plates and decorative art originally accompanied the text in the late 1800s. An introduction by Ola d'Aulaire, son of the creators of <em>D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths</em>, sets the stage for the young reader, and an afterword for adults by Hawthorne scholar Joel Pfister places <em>A Wonder Book</em> in Hawthorne's body of work and in historical context, conveying the strength of its romantic imagination in the face of the encroaching Industrial Revolution. Adults and collectors will find this major new edition a treasure and their children will happily enter a world of magic and imagination, led by one of the greatest American storytellers.</p><p><br><strong>Nathaniel Hawthorne</strong> (1804-1864), though best known for his novels and short stories for adults, also produced several works for children, including a companion volume to <em>A Wonder Book</em> called <em>Tanglewood Tales</em> (1853).<br> <em>About the Illustrator:</em><br> <strong>Walter Crane</strong> (1845-1915) was one of the most popular English illustrators of children's books in the late nineteenth century. He was one of the first book artists to experiment with color in picture books.<br><br>"A handsome replica of the original 1893 edition, <em>A Wonder Book for Girls &amp; Boys</em> by Nathaniel Hawthorne features Medusa, Hercules, Pandora, Midas et al--and the art of the illustrious Walter Crane.... Crane's color plates are lushly romantic in style; the plainer printed story titles and illuminated letters are just as beautiful."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Hawthorne's delightful retelling of Greek myths displays his command of narrative and character as well as his sense of adventure. The stories of Midas, Medusa, Hercules, and others will delight both children and adult readers."--<em>The Tampa Tribune Times</em><p></p><br>"An exceptionally fine series of Hawthorne retellings of Greek classics.... An excellent keepsake edition."--<em>The Children's Bookwatch</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Synergetic Classroom: Joyful Teaching and Gentle Discipline</h2><p>Whether this is your first year or your twentieth in the classroom - even if your student teaching is still ahead of you - this book will show you how to make every day of teaching a celebration!</p><p><p> The quality of public education in the United States and other countries of the West seems to be in slow but steady decline. Despite the vigorous efforts of educators, students now complete secondary school having learned less, on average, than they did decades ago. Universities regularly provide remedial courses to bring high school graduates up to standards formerly expected. Discipline problems at all levels of school have increased progressively, as has student apathy toward learning. Students still say they believe education is important but almost 50 percent of secondary students complain that school offers them little. They criticize lessons as boring and irrelevant to their lives. They say teachers are uninspiring and the curriculum out of touch with real life. Many of them say that, all in all, they get so little out of school they don't see any point in trying to learn. </p><p> Millions upon millions of dollars have been plowed into education in an attempt to reverse the decline. Teacher training has been overhauled. Magnet schools have been established in the performing arts, science and mathematics, physical education, and other specialties in hopes of motivating students. Early education programs have been put in place everywhere to give students a better start. Mentor teacher programs and in-service education intended to improve teaching have become standard in all school systems. But the results of these efforts have been disappointing. While pockets of true excellence shine here and there, the overall picture is dim. </p><p> As education worsens, fingers of blame are pointed in all directions. Choose your target: Societal values are in disarray. The family has broken down. Parents no longer support teachers and education. TV and home computers are more interesting than school. Violence rather than humane behavior is the major focus of the media. Drugs are making students mindless. Intimidating others has become the way to establish one's place in the world. Teacher training doesn't prepare teachers realistically. Tenure has removed teacher motivation to excel. Classes are too large. There are too many administrators. The curriculum is too watered down. The books students read, if they read at all, are insipid. There aren't enough computers in classrooms. Students' lives are too easy, too pampered. Students' lives are too difficult in this complex and demanding world. Too little money is spent on education. Too much money is spent on education. And so on. </p><p> All of these factors may be playing a part in dragging education down. Certainly some of them are. Teachers feel powerless. They don't see how they can do anything to correct a hedonistic society, the disintegrating family, the rampage of drugs, the appalling apathy of students, or the lack of support from parents. They can't make students behave or try to learn, but when students fail their classes and show disdain for education, teachers get the blame. It makes them want to throw in the towel. </p><p> Yet some teachers are notably successful. Their students learn, enjoy school, and appreciate education. Some of the graduates from public schools are among the most astute we have ever produced. What is going right for those teachers and students that is going wrong else where? Do their schools have more money? Do they have better facilities? Do those teachers know something the rest of us don't? </p><p> Money and facilities don't have much to do with their good fortune, but yes, the teachers do seem to know something important about making teaching effective and learning enjoyable. They know they do the most good at the point where they interface personally with individual students. They know how to rally students to them. They know how to build trust. They know how to strengthen student dignity and capitalize on it, rather than inadvertently saying or doing things that damage relations. They know how to communicate. They know how to help students resolve conflicts and maintain positive feelings. They know how to make lessons consistently interesting. They know how to use their personal charisma. By doing these things, they energize students, help them find enjoyment in school, and teach them skills and information of value. Students in turn respect those teachers, involve themselves in learning, and behave responsibly. In these classes, discipline problems are few and far between. Learning is busy and satisfying. Camaraderie is evident. Students and teacher feed energy to each other, producing the exhilaration in learning that most people experience only rarely. </p><p> That kind of teaching, herein called synergetic teaching, can extricate education from the quagmire in which it is bogged. More money is not the answer, nor are fancier schools or glitzier equipment. Supportive parents would be nice, but we can manage in their absence. Less media enthrallment with the worst in society would be helpful, but we can supply humaneness to offset it. It would be easier if we had students whose psyches were less damaged, but we can work with their strengths. It is a rare student, regardless of background, who cannot or will not respond to teachers who are trustworthy, kind, caring, and helpful, and who take a personal interest in them and make learning fun rather than dull. </p><p> Most of us can retool ourselves to teach in this way. But first we must recognize that our curriculum, activities, and discipline too often run contrary to students' needs and natures. We expect students, even when bored silly, to pay attention, show interest, and do as told. When they don't, we try to force them, seemingly not realizing that force produces emotions that shut off learning. We defeat ourselves by always telling students what to do while not allowing them to make decisions about their life in school. We miss the mark worst of all when we damage their dignity and trust. </p><p> </p><p> This book is intended to help all teachers work in the ways that have brought success to a fortunate few. It reveals no deep secrets but does point out serious errors commonly made in teaching and to how to remedy them. It explains how to work intentionally with students rather than inadvertently against them. It tells how to reduce student resistance by providing interesting activities and allowing students to learn in ways they enjoy. It tells how to communicate effectively, solve problems, and resolve conflicts. It tells how to earn students' trust so they will want to follow your lead. And finally, it she how to reduce discipline problems to a minimum and deal easily h the few that occur. </p><p> </p><p> Teachers have two great dreams&#x2013;to work with students who to learn, and to escape from the constant struggle against misbehavior. Synergetic teaching and discipline can help deliver those dreams. It can cause your students to learn, behave themselves, and give you respect. They will behave themselves because they want to. You will enjoy them, and they you. You can accomplish this by putting in place elements of teaching that lead to synergy&#x2013;that exhilarating state where everyone is involved and creativity abounds. Synergetic teaching and discipline remove most causes of misbehavior. When occasional misbehavior occurs, gentle intervention brings satisfactory resolution and leaves feelings intact. </p><p> With synergetic teaching and discipline in place, you can look forward to each day and go home at night pleasantly tired rather than raggedly frustrated. You may not attain these results all the time, but this much can be promised: If you conscientiously apply what is advocated in this book, your relations with students will improve markedly. Students will become more cooperative. Their misbehavior will decline, and you will have to expend only a fraction of your former effort on discipline. Teaching will become what you always hoped it might be.</p><p> <b>C.M.

Using rich new untapped archives, <i>States of Delinquency</i> is the first book to explore the experiences of young Mexican Americans, African Americans, and ethnic Euro-Americans in California correctional facilities including Whittier State School for Boys and the Preston School of Industry. Miroslava Ch�vez-Garc�a examines the ideologies and practices used by state institutions as they began to replace families and communities in punishing youth, and explores the application of science and pseudo-scientific research in the disproportionate classification of youths of color as degenerate. She also shows how these boys and girls, and their families, resisted increasingly harsh treatment and various kinds of abuse, including sterilization.</p><p>&#x201c;Miroslava Ch�vez-Garc�a digs into long-forgotten files and humanizes the forgotten victims of injustice. <i>States of Delinquency</i> exposes the hidden racial dynamics of California&#x2019;s juvenile justice system and makes us re-think the history of the child-saving movement.&#x201d;&#x2015;Tony Platt, author of <i>The Child Savers: The Invention of Delinquency</i><br><br>&#x201c;Impressively researched and passionately argued, <i>States of Delinquency</i> shows how racial prejudice and bogus social science reshaped early twentieth century juvenile corrections in California.

IG leverages information technologies to enforce policies, procedures and controls to manage information risk in compliance with legal and litigation demands, external regulatory requirements, and internal governance objectives. <i>Information Governance: Concepts, Strategies, and Best Practices </i>reveals how, and why, to utilize IG and leverage information technologies to control, monitor, and enforce information access and security policies.</p> <ul> <li>Written by one of the most recognized and published experts on information governance, including specialization in e-document security and electronic records management</li> <li>Provides big picture guidance on the imperative for information governance and best practice guidance on electronic document and records management</li> <li>Crucial advice and insights for compliance and risk managers, operations managers, corporate counsel, corporate records managers, legal administrators, information technology managers, archivists, knowledge managers, and information governance professionals</li> </ul> IG sets the policies that control and manage the use of organizational information, including social media, mobile computing, cloud computing, email, instant messaging, and the use of e-documents and records. This extends to e-discovery planning and preparation. <i>Information Governance: Concepts, Strategies, and Best Practices</i> provides step-by-step guidance for developing information governance strategies and practices to manage risk in the use of electronic business documents and records.</p><p><p>Big Data is here to stay. It has been estimated that 90% of the data in the world today was created in the last two years. At the enterprise level, though, only about a quarter of this data actually has business value. Storing and maintaining unneeded &#x201c;data debris&#x201d; is costly and diverts resources away from the management of high value information. Organizations need to adopt information governance (IG) policies in order to streamline and systematize approaches to Big Data and to more efficiently meet compliance and legal demands. <i>Information Governance</i> is the first book to address both the big-picture concepts and the proven, detailed best practices that are central to deploying IG.</p> <p>This book addresses the five key impact areas of IG, as set out in the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM): Legal Functions, Records and Information Management (RIM), Information Technology (IT), Privacy &amp; Security, and Business Operations. Leading subject matter experts such as Barclay Blair, Monica Crocker, Charles Dollar, Randy Kahn, Esq., Barry Murphy, and others provide valuable new insights. Specific recommended processes, technologies, and best practices are presented in a clear, understandable format. For mid- and large-sized enterprises, information is a key source of value. But retaining excessive information also carries legal and compliance risks. In <i>Information Governance</i>, Robert Smallwood demonstrates just how costly mismanaged information can be. To minimize risk related to poor IG, organizations need to pare information down to the essentials and secure it properly. Inside, learn how to do these things the right way, to ensure compliance with internal governance requirements and external regulatory and legal demands.</p> <p>If information governance is so important, why have IG programs not been adopted by more organizations? And more importantly, why have so many existing IG programs failed so miserably? Smallwood explains that costs and benefits associated with information governance are still not widely understood. In the pages of <i>Information Governance,</i> the author builds the business case for IG through a comprehensive, pioneering approach for information-related risk assessments that leverages high value information.</p> <p>Carrying out well-considered IG initiatives is not easy, particularly when so much valuable information is stored and accessed by third-party service providers. Social media, mobile computing, and cloud computing, and certainly traditional e-mail, are exposed to leakage and theft risks. Even discarding unneeded information in a legally defensible way can be quite challenging. <i>Information Governance</i> addresses the practicalities of managing these various information platforms. This comprehensive book&#x2014;the most comprehensive ever compiled on IG&#x2014;is an essential resource to equip enterprises with a sound approach to governing and leveraging information in the age of Big Data.</p><p><b>The first comprehensive approach to Information Governance</b></p> <p>By now, everyone knows that information can be enormously valuable, but how is that value affected by the huge costs involved in storing and maintaining it? How can organizations separate the &#x201c;irrelevant sludge&#x201d; of information from the real data goldmines? Crucially, how can information be kept, stored, secured, accessed, and when necessary, destroyed in a way that is consistent with legal requirements? <i>Information Governance</i> provides answers to these questions and many more. From broad concepts to the nuts and bolts of implementation, this book is an essential first step in any successful IG program.</p> <p><i>Information Governance</i> is for CIOs, legal advisors, governance and compliance professionals, records managers, and anyone who is involved in managing content and information at an enterprise level. The field of IG is about more than just transferring traditional records management strategies to new technologies. Readers will learn about:</p> <ul> <li><b>The key components of a successful IG program</b></li> <li><b>Risk assessment for information governance</b></li> <li><b>Developing and implementing internal IG policies</b></li> <li><b>Legally defensible disposal of unneeded data</b></li> <li><b>Appraising the value of existing records and documents</b></li> <li><b>Electronic document security (EDS) technologies and policies</b></li> <li><b>IG for social media, e-mail, mobile devices, and e-records</b></li> <li><b>Privacy considerations and regulations</b></li> </ul> <p>With a career of over 25 years in information management concentrating in electronic document technologies, noted authority Robert Smallwood has developed an expert approach to IG that is an important element of long-term program success. <i>Information Governance</i> provides the strategies that organizations need to get and stay ahead in a world of Big Data and increasing compliance and legal demands.</p> <p><i>Information Governance</i> features major contributions from the following experts in the field:</p> <p><b>Lori J.

The Forest Ranger has been essential reading for generations of professionals and scholars in forestry, public administration, and organizational behavior who are interested in the administration of public lands and how the top managers of a large, dispersed organization with multiple objectives like the Forest Service shape the behavior of its field officers into a coherent, unified program. Published as a special reprint in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Forest Service, The Forest Ranger is as relevant and timely today as when it was first issued in 1960. In addition to the original text, this special reprint of The Forest Ranger includes two new forewords and an afterword that highlight how much we have learned from Herbert Kaufman. The first foreword, by Harold K. (Pete) Steen, former president of the Forest History Society, considers the book&#39;s impact on the forestry community and explains its continued relevance in light of changes in the culture and mission of today&#39;s Forest Service. The second, by Richard P. Nathan, codirector of the Rockefeller Institute of Government, considers the book&#39;s contribution to our understanding of administrative and organizational behavior. The new afterword by author Herbert Kaufman describes how his landmark study came into being and offers a candid assessment of how his theories about the agency&#39;s operations and its future have held up over time. In 1960, the Forest Service had a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and The Forest Ranger was a seminal analysis of the hows and whys of its success. Kaufmanalso warned, however, that an organization so unified and well adapted to its environment would have difficulties navigating social change. He was right in his concerns: the environmental, civil rights, and women&#39;s movements have all presented challenges to the character and purpose of the Forest Service, ultimately changing the organization in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Now, as then, The Forest Ranger is a striking and prescient case study of how a complex organization operates and evolves over time.</p><p>Herbert Kaufman, now retired, was a professor of political science at Yale University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. His other books include The Administrative Behavior of Federal Bureau Chiefs; Red Tape: Its Origins, Uses, and Abuses; Are Government Organizations Immortal?; and The Limits of Organizational Change.&#34;The best single account of forestry management remains Herbert Kaufman&#39;s The Forest Ranger.&#34; -- John J. DiIulio, Jr., University of Pennsylvania &#34;Kaufman seeks to &#39;portray an organization accurately, to capture the drama, the excitement, the spirit of administration.&#39; In this respect The Forest Ranger is perhaps without a peer. But more importantly, this book bears fresh insights into many facets of administration. Its reading should be a rewarding experience to any administrator...

Does the question even make sense today? For centuries, the question of the meaning or purpose of human life was assumed by scholars and theologians to have a religious answer: life has meaning because humans were made in the image of a good god. In the 19th century, however, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution changed everything-and the human organism was seen to be more machine than spirit. Ever since, with the rise of science and decline of religious belief, there has been growing interest - and growing doubt - about whether human life really does have meaning. If it does, where might we find it? <br><br>The historian and philosopher of science Michael Ruse investigates this question, and wonders whether we can find a new meaning to life within Darwinian views of human nature. If God no longer exists-or if God no longer cares-rather than promoting a bleak nihilism, many Darwinians think we can convert Darwin into a form of secular humanism. Ruse explains that, in a tradition going back to the time of Darwin himself, and represented today by the evolutionist E. O. Wilson, evolution is seen as progress -- "from monad to man" - and that positive meaning is found in continuing and supporting this upwards path of life. In<em> A Meaning to Life</em>, Michael Ruse argues that this is a false turn, and there is no real progress in the evolutionary process. Rather, meaning in the Darwinian age can be found if we turn to a kind of Darwinian existentialism, seeing our evolved human nature as the source of all meaning, both in the intellectual and social worlds. Ruse argues that it is only by accepting our true nature - evolved over millennia - that humankind can truly find what is meaningful.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Ruse </strong>is the Lucyle T.

He has written or edited more than fifty books, including most recently <em>On Purpose</em> (2017) and the OUP volumes <em>Darwinism as Religion</em> <em></em>(2016), and <em>The Problem of War </em>(2018).<br><br>"<em>A Meaning to Life</em>�engagingly addresses the essential question of meaning in life, and is written by a �philosopher of evolutionary biology who has wrestled with this difficult issue throughout his long and distinguished �career. �Michael Ruse takes the reader on a personal journey, starting with the ways in which meaning has been viewed by religious and secular thinkers, then turning to how science overturned our understanding of meaning, and finally drawing on Darwinian biology to present a framework for his own position.� While confident in the capacities of science, Ruse humbly ventures his own approach to questions that ultimately lie beyond the reach of science.� This book is a must read as a model of Socratic honesty about meaning in life." -- Michael L. Peterson, Professor of Philosophy, Asbury Theological Seminary, and author of <em>C. S. Lewis and the Christian Worldview</em><p></p><br>"Another valuable book from the inimitable Michael Ruse who continues to write about religion and related matters in a way that is intelligent and neither fawning nor condescending. Do not be deceived by the apparent lightness of touch and endless Ruse humor (particularly about warthogs); this is a book with rich insights on almost every page." -- Michael J. Reiss, <em>University College London</em><p></p><br>"Thoroughly infused with autobiography, casual erudition, and the characteristic humor of its author, A Meaning to Life gives an account of its title for a world in which the nature of humanity stems not from relations to God or religion, but to evolution. Tracing right and wrong turns in Darwinian conceptions of meaning, its provocative, "existentialist" proposal demands attention." -- Anjan Chakravartty, <em>University of Miami </em><p></p><br></p><h2>Courageous Resistance: The Power of Ordinary People</h2><p>During times of grave injustice, some individuals, groups, and organizations courageously resist maltreatment of all people, regardless of their backgrounds.

For those who study grave injustices such as human rights abuses, there is often a sense of despair and hopelessness regarding what people can and have done done to each other. Uniquely, what this book offers is hope. Pulling together research from multiple fields and providing a needed integrated interdisciplinary approach, this book explains how and when people choose to resist injustice. Drawing on rich case studies ranging from Rwanda to Nazi Germany, it builds a compelling and theoretically informed argument for understanding how ordinary people can and do resist injustices of all types as individuals and groups and through institutions." - Kathryn Sikkink, Professor of Political Science, University of Minnesota Courgeous Resistance , remarkable in so many ways, is a major contribution to peace, conflict, and nonviolence studies, focusing on strategies for peacemaking employed by 'ordinary people' in extraordinary circumstances.

Algorithms for animation, geometric modeling, and texturing all must feed their results through some sort of rendering process for the results to be visible in an image. Focusing on realistic images, physically based rendering incorporates ideas from a range of disciplines, including physics, biology, psychology, cognitive science, and mathematics. This book presents the algorithms of modern photorealistic rendering and follows step by step the creation of a complete rendering system. As each new rendering concept is introduced it is also shown implemented in code&#x2015;there is no better way to understand the subtle and complex process of rendering. The code itself is highly readable, written in the <i>literate programming</i> style that mixes text describing the system with the code that implements it. The result is a stunning achievement in graphics education for students, professionals, and researchers. <br><br>*CD-ROM with the source code for a complete rendering system for Windows, OS X, &amp; Linux&#x2015;with many examples of images created by the system throughout the 4 color text<br>*The code and text are tightly woven together through the technique of literate programming with a unique indexing feature that lists all locations of functions, variables, and methods on the page they are first described<br>*The most complete guide to understanding, designing, and building a rendering system</p><p>The most complete guide to rendering&#x2014;in both concept and code"Computer graphics, and rendering in particular, is full of beautiful theory.... This book turns the theory of image-making into a practical method for creating images." ?from the foreword by Pat Hanrahan, Canon USA Professor, Stanford University <br>From movies to video games, computer-rendered images are pervasive today. <b>Physically Based Rendering</b> introduces the concepts and theory of photorealistic rendering hand in hand with the source code for a sophisticated renderer. By coupling the discussion of rendering algorithms with their implementations, Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys are able to reveal many of the details and subtleties of these algorithms. But this book goes further; it also describes the design strategies involved with building real systems?there is much more to writing a good renderer than stringing together a set of fast algorithms. The rendering system described in this book is itself highly readable, written in a style called <i>literate programming</i> that mixes text describing the system with the code that implements it. Literate programming gives a gentle introduction to working with programs of this size. This lucid pairing of text and code offers the most complete and in-depth book available for understanding, designing, and building physically realistic rendering systems.

He was famous in his day as a translator, orator, and historian, and was the best-selling author of the fifteenth century. Bruni's <i>History of the Florentine People</i> in twelve books is generally considered the first modern work of history, and was widely imitated by humanist historians for two centuries after its official publication by the Florentine Signoria in 1442. This edition makes it available for the first time in English translation.</p><p><p>James Hankins is Professor of History at Harvard University and founder and General Editor of the I Tatti Renaissance Library. He is the editor of <i>The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Philosophy</i> and <i>Renaissance Civic Humanism</i> and is widely regarded as one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on humanist political thought.</p>&#x201c;Bruni, in trying to demonstrate that Florence could trace its legitimate republican tradition back to deep antiquity, wrote a history of his city on the model of the ancient history of Rome by Livy. As he did so, he read Livy's eloquent, stagy book in a very imaginative, critical way. From the ancient historian's idealized account of virtuous Romans, Bruni reconstructed the virtuous and powerful world of their enemies, the Etruscans--from whom, he claimed, the modern Tuscans were descended. In Bruni's historical imagination, Livy's stories of Horatius, heroically defending the bridge across the Tiber, and Mucius Scaevola, thrusting his hand into the fire to show his contempt for death, metamorphosed into instances of Roman weakness, superstition and dishonesty.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony T.

Everything about them is attractive: the blue of their dust jackets and cloth covers, the restrained and elegant design, the clarity of the typesetting, the quality of the paper, and not least the sensible price.

It covers practice patterns and scales in all keys and tempos, transcribing solos of master improvisers, learning the jazz repertoire, and playing with other musicians. Chapter topics include how to practice, creatively improvise, and teach improvisation; major innovators; important contributors; women in jazz; chord substitutions; scales; and form. Each chapter also contains theory and ear exercises.</p><p>This book covers practice patterns and scales in all keys and tempos, transcribing solos of master improvisors, learning the jazz repertoire, and playing with other musicians. Students and professionals at any level of proficiency will find the material beneficial. The text may be applied to any instrument, or a classroom of varied instrumentation.Preface <p> It is gratifying that, since the publication of the first edition in 1989 and the second in 1995, many college educators, private instructors, and students of jazz have found Creative Jazz Improvisation to be a valuable aid in their musical growth. This text is a direct outgrowth of over twenty-one years of experiences teaching jazz improvisation at the college level, as well as my own personal quest to develop as a jazz artist. </p><p> I believe there is a direct parallel between life and art. The pursuit of understanding in any art form can teach us much about ourselves and serve as a catalyst for a lifetime of learning. My own musical perspectives have evolved since the second edition of this text was written, and much of this new information has been incorporated into the present volume. Therefore, I believe this edition to be much more than a minor reworking of the previous one. However, all of the same features that made Creative Jazz Improvisation a popular choice for classroom use are retained, including:</p><p>The philosophy that there are several paths to the same goal and that each student learns in his or her own unique way. An orientation in difficulty toward college-level and intermediate-to-advanced musicians. For students at the high-school or community college level or adult beginners, I strongly recommend the entry-level companion to this text, Creative Beginnings, which comes with a play-along compact disc. The division of the majority of chapters into sections devoted to jazz theory, exercises over a specified chord progression, a list of relevant compositions, and a transcribed solo which has been transposed and edited for concert pitch treble clef, B6, E6 and bass clef instruments. A thorough discussion of all facets of jazz theory, including major scale modes, forms and chord substitutions, melodic minor modes, diminished and whole-tone scales, pentatonic scales, and intervallic and "free" improvisation. The keying of the chord progressions to either the widespread Jamey Aebersold series or the compact disc accompanying Creative Beginnings. Exercises that include not only basic scales and arpeggios but also melodic ideas taken directly from cited recordings by master improvisers, arranged in order of relative difficulty. The indexing of the list of compositions to legal fake-books, particularly the New Real Book and the Aebersold play-along series. The correlation of half of the transcribed solos with the widely available anthology, The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz. The convenience of allowing a classroom of mixed instrumentation to work simultaneously from the text. </p><p> Differences between the second and third editions include:</p><p>The addition of a new chapter, "Whom to Listen To," which lists major innovators, important contributors, and women in jazz. The expansion of the chapter on "Rhythm," with considerable new information and exercises. Replacement of two transcriptions with more readily playable examples, including Miles Davis's "Solea" solo (in place of Wayne Shorter's "Masqualero" solo), and Bill Evans's "Autumn Leaves" solo (in lieu of Dizzy Gillespie's "Stardust" solo). In addition, J. J. Johnson's solo on "Aquarius" has been renotated in long meter to make it easier to read. An expansion of the list of compositions in each chapter to reflect the ever-increasing number of play-along recordings by Jamey Aebersold. The third edition is now keyed to the first eighty-five volumes in his series, A New Approach to Jazz Improvisation. An extensive reworking of all portions of the text to improve readability and reflect recent information. A reappraisal of all exercises, with selected replacements and additions. The incorporation of inspirational epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter. A continued investigation of the how to bridge the gap between the technical and intellectual aspects of jazz with the creative and intuitive state of mind. Many of these ideas may be traced to my exposure to the concepts of pianist Kenny Werner, and I am indebted to his willingness to allow me to incorporate some of his ideas into this volume. </p><p> This text reflects the influences of my previous teachers, particularly David Baker, Woody Shaw, and Kenny Werner, the many jazz artists whose work I have studied and transcribed, and the pedagogical concepts of Jamey Aebersold. I gratefully acknowledge these people, as well as the staff at Prentice Hall, particularly my acquisitions editor, Christopher Johnson and my production and copy editor, Laura Lawrie. I sincerely hope the readers of this text will find it a valuable aid in their growth as musicians.</p></p><h2>King Cophetua</h2><p>It is All Saints' Day, 1917. Our narrator, a former soldier, recalls the events surrounding his arrival at the home of Jacques Nueil, an aviator and avant-garde composer. The Great War is leading up to images of the Russian Revolution, and from Nueil's villa the narrator hears the sounds of bombs dropping in the distance. This carefully paced, mysteriously atmospheric novel is inspired by vivid memory and by two images, Goya's engraving entitled <i>La Mala Noche</i> and Burne-Jones's painting <i>King Cophetua and the Beggar Girl</i>.</p><p>Julien Gracq (1910-2007), born Louis Poirier in Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, was one of the greatest French writers of the twentieth century. His work included essays, criticism, fiction and journalism. He won but refused the Prix Goncourt in 1951 for his novel <i>Le Rivage des Syrtes</i> (<i>The Opposing Shore</i>). This retiring and misunderstood figure said he wrote "to settle a score with expression itself, to give form, stability, precision to things that are vague in the mind.""A slender beautifully written work takes us into the war-torn French countryside in 1917...its theme of anxiety created by a distant media driven war proves an apt metaphor for our time."&#x2014;<i>East Bay Express</i></p><h2>From Phonics to Fluency: Effective Teaching of Decoding and Reading Fluency in the Elementary School</h2><p>The past decade has seen renewed emphasis on &#34;decoding&#34;--learning to read by breaking down words into parts.

The Atlas includes more than one hundred maps, with accompanying text, that give an in-depth review of Jewish history throughout the world from the 5th to the 17th centuries.<br>The Atlas covers milestone events of Jewish history during this period: the dispersion of the Jews in the fourth and fifth centuries up to the Crusades; the Black Death; the expulsion from Spain; the persecutions of 1648 in eastern Europe and the Sabbatean movement. The maps and text illustrate the sequence of persecution, expulsion, migration, and destruction, on the one hand, and a spiritual, religious, and cultural flowering, on the other.<br>For students, scholars, and the general reader, the Atlas of Medieval Jewish History is a welcome new reference that will be an indispensable guide to this era.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: HebrewAtlases dealing with the history of the Jews have begun appearing in English only recently. It is therefore a great contribution to the field to have this translation of a volume first published in Israel, where scholars have long realized the importance of such works for both students and researchers. The meticulous research of Beinart (Hebrew Univ., Jerusalem), one of the foremost scholars of medieval Jewish history, is evident on every page. He has divided the book into three major sections: an initial portion extending from the barbarian invasion of Europe to the Crusades; a second devoted to the period ending with the expulsion from Spain; and a final segment covering developments through the Chmielnicki massacres and Sabbatean movement. Every student of the period will treasure the 116 maps and illustrations, demographic data, and artwork. The volume also contains a useful bibliography and map, subject, and people indexes. This much-needed research and educational tool makes an excellent companion to Evyatar Friesel's Atlas of Modern Jewish History ( LJ 1/1/91); it covers in depth material touched on in Martin Gilbert's The Illustrated Atlas of Jewish Civilization (one of LJ 's "Best Reference Books," 4/15/91).

The Government Inspector, a perennial favourite on stage and screen, is considered a national institution in Russia, and Gogol&#39;s stories present us with one of the most marvellous worlds a writer has ever created. His quirky characters - the lowly official who imagines himself to be the King of Spain, the man committed to chase his nose around St. Petersburg, a whole village paralyzed at the prospect of being visited by an authority from the capital - are immortal. Although Gogol&#39;s fiction was commandeered by Russia&#39;s progressive critics as the work of an important social commentator, he was in many ways an arch-conservative, and there is a madcap strain in it that makes him a precursor of Kafka and absurdist drama.</p><p></p><h2>Traditional Tapa Textiles of the Pacific</h2><p>The manufacture of tapa cloth, made from the inner bark of certain trees, is one of the most intriguing products of the cultures of the Pacific islands. In several parts of Melanesia from New Guinea to Vanuatu, in Fiji, and on most of the high islands of Polynesia from Hawaii to Tahiti, the Marquesas, Tonga, Samoa, Niue, the Cook Islands, and New Zealand, making barkcloth is an ancient craft that has been practiced for thousands of years. Traditional Tapa Textiles of the Pacific presents a complete range of the ancient art of tapa, from cloth brought back from the first European voyages to the Pacific to contemporary examples. The origins, materials, and manufacturing techniques are described, as well as tapa&#39;s cultural context and uses in weddings, funerals, clothing, dance, and ornament. With more than two hundred color illustrations, many published for the first time, this book is a comprehensive survey of this distinctive branch of Pacific art.</p><p>Roger Neich is Curator of Ethnology at Auckland Museum, which houses the largest collection of tapa in the world. He has studied the ethnic arts of the Pacific for over twenty years, and published numerous works on the subject. Mick Pendergrast of Auckland Museum has spent over forty years traveling through Polynesia and is an expert on crafts of the Pacific and New Zealand.</p><h2>The Essential Guardini</h2><p>For American Catholics before and after Vatican II, Guardini was best known for his writings on the liturgy and his profound meditation on the life and person of Jesus Christ, The Lord; but in Europe, he was for decades an influential spiritual, intellectual, and cultural guide, known for his deep, clear vision of the church and the world. The Essential Guardini contains some of the most influential writings of Romano Guardini. Selections have been organized around our world, Jesus Christ, the Church, and liturgy and worship. Includes bibliography and index.

He and his contemporaries in other Muslim countries are shaping what may become Islam's equivalent of the Christian Reformation: a period of questioning traditional practices and beliefs and, ultimately, of upheaval. Presenting eleven of his essays, this volume makes Soroush's thought readily available in English for the first time. The essays set forth his views on such matters as the freedom of Muslims to interpret the Qur'an, the inevitability of change in religion, the necessity of freedom of belief, and the compatibility of Islam and democracy. Throughout, Soroush emphasizes the rights of individuals in their relationship with both government and God, explaining that the ideal Islamic state can only be defined by the beliefs and will of the majority.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mahmoud Sadri</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology at Texas Women's University.<br> <br> <strong>Ahmad Sadri</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology at Lake Forest College.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Persian</p><h2>Conducting Online Surveys</h2><p><b>Conducting Online Surveys</b> is a complete guide to conducting survey research using digital modalities.

His apothegm &#x201c;<i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>&#x201d; marked the birth of the mind-body problem, while his creation of so-called Cartesian coordinates have made our physical and intellectual conquest of physical space possible.<br><br>But Descartes had a mysterious and mystical side, as well. Almost certainly a member of the occult brotherhood of the Rosicrucians, he kept a secret notebook, now lost, most of which was written in code. After Descartes&#x2019;s death, Gottfried Leibniz, inventor of calculus and one of the greatest mathematicians in history, moved to Paris in search of this notebook&#x2014;and eventually found it in the possession of Claude Clerselier, a friend of Descartes. Leibniz called on Clerselier and was allowed to copy only a couple of pages&#x2014;which, though written in code, he amazingly deciphered there on the spot. Leibniz&#x2019;s hastily scribbled notes are all we have today of Descartes&#x2019;s notebook, which has disappeared.<br><br>Why did Descartes keep a secret notebook, and what were its contents?

For like Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon in 49 B.C., Jeanne Brochard crossed the Creuse River, which lay between her family home, in the region of Poitou, and the small town of La Haye, which lies in the region of Touraine, in western central France.<br><br>The Descartes family had originated in Poitou and had lived for many years in the town of Chatellerault, about twenty-five kilometers south of La Haye. Descartes' parents, Joachim Descartes and Jeanne Brochard, who were married on January 15, 1589, owned a stately mansion in the center of Chatellerault, at 126 rue Carrou-Bernard (today's rue Bourbon).<br><br>Joachim Descartes was the councillor of the Parliament of Brittany, and this important job kept him away in distant Rennes. Jeanne needed her mother's help in birthing the baby, and this is why she traveled north and across the river to Touraine to give birth to Ren� Descartes in her mother's house in La Haye. Sometime later, once she had recovered, she returned to Chatellerault. Despite this accident of birth, throughout his life, Rene's friends would often call him Rene <i>le Poitevin</i>--Rene of Poitou.<br><br>The regions of Poitou and Touraine include pastoral farmlands that have been cultivated since antiquity. There are low hills, many of which are forested, and rich flatlands, irrigated by rivers that cut through this fertile land. Cows and sheep graze here, and many kinds of crops are grown. La Haye is a small town of stone houses with gray roofs. At the time of Descartes, the population of the town numbered about 750 people.<br><br>Chatellerault is a larger, more genteel town than La Haye, with wide avenues and an elegant city square, and it serves as the hub of rural life in the region. Because this part of France is so fertile and rich in water and agricultural resources, the people who live here are well off. North of La Haye one can still visit the beautiful chateaus of the Loire Valley, as well as forests and game reserves, which existed at the time of Descartes. The chateaus, many of them restored to their original state, with lavish fifteenth- and sixteenth-century furnishings and surrounded by sculpted gardens, give us a feel for the life of the rich at the time of Descartes.<br><br>While the regions of Poitou and Touraine are similar in their topography, scenery, and the way the towns and villages are laid out, there was one important difference between them. While Poitou was mainly Protestant, Touraine was mostly Catholic. We know that in the fifteen years from 1576 to 1591, there were only seventy-two Protestant baptisms in La Haye. This significant religious difference between the two regions would affect the life of Ren� Descartes. For this accident of birth--being born, and later also raised, in a strongly Catholic region while his family hailed from a Protestant one--would exert a significant impact on Ren�'s personality, thus influencing his actions throughout his life and determining the course of development of his philosophical and scientific ideas and the way he divulged them to the world.<br><br>Descartes lived in a century that knew severe tensions, including wars, between Catholics and Protestants. The fact that he was born in a Catholic region and would be raised by a devout Catholic governess, while many of his family's friends and associates in Poitou were Protestants, contributed to Descartes' natural secretiveness. It also made him, as an adult, much more concerned about the Catholic Inquisition than perhaps he should have been, and not worried enough about the persecution he could face from Protestants. Consequently, Descartes would refrain from publishing elements of his science and philosophy for fear of the Inquisition, and yet would readily settle in Protestant countries, where academics and theologians would viciously attack his work in part because they knew he was a Catholic.<br><br>Ren� Descartes was baptized a Catholic in Saint George's Chapel in La Haye, a twelfth-century Norman church, on April 3, 1596. His baptismal certificate reads:<br>This day was baptized Ren�, son of the noble man Joachym Descartes, councillor of the King and his Parliament of Brittany, and of damsel Jeanne Brochard. His godparents, noble Michel Ferrand, councillor of the King, lieutenant general of Chatellerault, and noble Ren� Brochard, councillor of the King, judge magistrate at Poitiers, and dame Jeanne Proust, wife of monsieur Sain, controller of weights and measures for the King at Chatellerault.<br>[signed]<br>Ferrand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehanne Proust&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rene Brochard<br>Michel Ferrand, Ren� Descartes' godfather, was his great-uncle--Joachim Descartes' uncle on his mother's side. Rene Brochard was the baby's grandfather, Jeanne Brochard's father. Jeanne's mother, Ren� Descartes' grandmother, was Jeanne Sain. Her brother's wife was Jeanne (Jehanne) Proust.<br>***<br>The name La Haye comes from the French word <i>haie</i>, meaning hedge. Originally the town was named Haia, and in the eleventh century, as the language evolved, the spelling was changed to Haya. In Descartes' time it was called La Haye-en-Touraine. In 1802, the town's name was changed to La Haye-Descartes, in honor of the philosopher, and in 1967, "La Haye" was altogether dropped and the town is now known as Descartes.<br><br>There was once a castle in the area, and the wealthiest and most powerful citizens of La Haye lived in it. As the feudal system disintegrated, the castle was abandoned and the people moved down to the town, where they could live more comfortably. But life in this area remained difficult. People suffered both from wars and from disease. The plague ravaged La Haye and its surroundings several times in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In 1607, the town was placed under quarantine after a recurrence of the plague killed many people in the area.<br><br>In early times, the hedges denoted by the French name Haia (or Haya or Haie) stood for thorny hedges that were planted by the townspeople in an effort to defend themselves and their property from marauding bands of brigands and highwaymen that pillaged and looted the countryside. But as times improved after the duke of Anjou took control of the area in September 1596--six months after the birth of Rene Descartes--the hedges implied by the name of the town came to mean hedges of beautiful gardens. To this day, this part of France is known for its exquisite gardens and areas of great natural beauty.<br><br>Late in life, just before he left on his final journey to Stockholm, Descartes wrote to his dearest friend, Princess Elizabeth: "A man who was born in the gardens of Touraine, shouldn't he avoid going to live in the land of the bears, between rocks and ice?" Descartes may well have been thinking of the garden of his own childhood home, his grandmother's house in La Haye, when he wrote these words to Elizabeth. Descartes' childhood home is an attractive two-story country house with four large rooms, although it is not nearly as impressive as the family mansion in Chatellerault. But it is surrounded by an exuberant garden, now restored to its original state, with flowers under the generous canopy of graceful trees. One can imagine the young boy enjoying many hours of undisturbed thinking and playing in this tranquil garden.<br>***<br>A year after Ren� was born, shortly after giving birth to her fourth child, Jeanne Brochard died. The newborn survived for three more days, and then died too. Some of Descartes' biographers have written that Rene's personality was deeply affected by the loss of his mother, and have even speculated that the young boy blamed himself for her death because he did not quite understand--the event having taken place so close to his own birth--that she died sometime after giving birth to her <i>next </i>child.<br><br>After the death of his wife, Joachim remarried. He took a Breton woman named Anne Morin as his wife, and with her had another son and another daughter (and two other babies who died in infancy). They bought a house in Rennes, where Ren�'s older sister joined them in 1610, and where she got married in 1613 to a local man. Until then, Rene and his older brother and sister were raised by a governess. Rene Descartes was extremely attached to his governess, who was a devout Catholic. She lived to old age, and Descartes specified in his will that she was to receive a significant amount of money annually for her support.<br><br>As a child, Ren� became known as the young philosopher of the family because he had a great curiosity about the world, always wanting to know why things were the way they were. The child grew up in the natural environment of farming and hunting and strolling in the woods. Throughout his life he would make references to the bucolic land of his birth and its natural rhythms. In letters to friends, and in published works, he would describe his childhood memories: the smell of the earth after a rainstorm; the trees at different seasons of the year; the process of fermentation of hay, and the making of new wine; the churning of butter from fresh milk; and the feel of the dust rising up from the earth as it was being plowed. Perhaps it was this early closeness to nature that kindled his interest in physics and mathematics as means for understanding nature and unraveling her secrets.<br><br>The Descartes family was wealthy, and Ren� would inherit even more assets directly from his grandfathers on both sides, both of whom had been successful medical doctors. His great-grandfather Jean Ferrand had been the personal physician of Queen Eleanor of Austria, the wife of Francis I of France, in the middle of the sixteenth century. He attained great wealth, which was eventually passed on to his daughter Claude, who married Pierre Descartes. Their son was Joachim Descartes, Ren�'s father. In 1566, when Joachim was only three years old, his father, Pierre, died of kidney stones. Pierre's father-in-law, Jean Ferrand, Queen Eleanor's personal physician, performed the autopsy on his son-in-law. In 1570 he wrote up the results of the operation and published them in a scientific paper, in Latin, about lithiasis--the formation of stony concretions in the body. His deep curiosity about nature--even to the point of dissecting the body of his own son-in-law--was passed on to his descendants. While, unlike his grandparents, Ren� Descartes would not pursue medicine as a profession, late in life he would dissect many animals in search of the secret to eternal life.<br>***<br>Ren� Descartes would spend much time during his adult life managing his inheritance. This wealth, including significant land holdings in Poitou, would enable him to pursue his interests without concern about a livelihood. It would afford him to indulge his whim of volunteering for military campaigns as a gentleman soldier without compensation--simply for the thrill of adventure. He would be able to afford luxurious accommodations wherever he traveled, and to employ servants and a valet. His money would even allow him to look after the education of his staff, thus sharing with them some of the privilege of his family's wealth. Descartes would grow up to be a very generous employer and friend.<br><br>Despite Adrien Baillet's statement in his very comprehensive 1691 biography of Descartes that the family belonged to the nobility, recent research indicates that, as far as Rene's life is concerned, this was not true. The renowned French historian Genevieve Rodis-Lewis explains in her 1995 biography, <i>Descartes</i>, that the Descartes family gained the rank of knighthood, the lowest status of nobility in France, only in 1668--eighteen years after Ren�'s death. According to French law, nobility was conferred on families after three successive generations had served the king in high office. Joachim Descartes certainly held such a position, and some have argued that he had originally sought to become councillor to the Parliament of Brittany in hopes of obtaining nobility status for his descendents. But Rene Descartes would choose a different direction in life, and so nobility would be conferred on the family only after another member had satisfied the three-generations requirement, years after Ren�'s death.<br><br>After he remarried, Joachim Descartes spent most of his time in Rennes with his new wife and the children she bore him. He also had interests and family business farther south and west in Nantes, also in Brittany. As they grew older, Rene and his brother and sister traveled frequently to visit their father. Eventually, Rene Descartes would see all of western France as his home territory, since time in his later childhood was spent throughout the regions of Poitou, Touraine, and Brittany.<br>But the frequent travel throughout the region was hard on the boy. In adulthood, Descartes described his health as a child as poor, and recounted in letters to friends that every doctor who had ever seen him as a child had said that he was in such poor health that he would most likely die at a young age. His devoted governess took such good care of him, however, that when he was eleven years old he was healthy enough to be sent away to study at the prestigious Jesuit College of La Fl�che.<br>Chapter 2<br><i>Jesuit Mathematics and the Pleasures of the Capital</i><br>IN 1603, KING HENRY IV, WHO HAD been raised a Protestant but converted to Catholicism, gave the Jesuits, as a gesture of his goodwill toward this powerful Catholic order, his ch�teau and vast grounds in the town of La Fl�che, to be used by them as the site of a new college. The Jesuits enlarged the chateau, and the result was a series of large interconnected Renaissance buildings with spacious, square, symmetric inner courtyards. Entering the grounds, one is struck by the perfect order and symmetry of the checkerboard array of grand courtyards, and by the well-manicured gardens beyond them. This is one of the most impressive college grounds anywhere; today it is the site of a military academy, the Prytan�e National Militaire.<br><br>La Fl�che was well chosen for a college. It lies in Anjou, north of Touraine, in a rich area with forests and gentle rolling hills. The town is attractive, with a river running through its center and lush meadows surrounding it. The gate of the college opens right into the spacious town square. Once students left the grounds of the college, they were in the center of the town with its many places to eat, drink, and find entertainment.<br><br>The college was inaugurated by King Henry IV, and opened its gates in 1604. France's brightest students from the best families were encouraged to apply for acceptance. Among the students accepted to the first class to enter this elite new college was Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), who would become Descartes' most devoted and loyal friend.<br><br>The college was run as a semimilitary school. The students had to wear a uniform, including breeches with pom-pom fastenings, a fancy blue blouse with large-puffed sleeves, and a felt hat. Each student was given a long list of items he had to bring to school. These included candles, various kinds of pencils, quills, and notebooks, and items of personal use.</p><h2>Messianic Beliefs and Imperial Politics in Medieval Islam: The �&#x20ac;~Abbasid Caliphate in the Early Ninth Century (Studies in Comparative Religion)</h2><p>Messianic Beliefs and Imperial Politics in Medieval Islam analyzes the role of Muslim messianic and apocalyptic beliefs in the development of the &#39;Abb?sid Caliphate to highlight connections between charismatic authority and institutional developments in the early ninth century. Hayrettin Y�cesoy studies the relationship between rulers and religion to advance understanding of the era&#39;s political actions and, more specifically, to illustrate how messianic beliefs influenced &#39;Abb?sid imperial politics and contributed to the reshaping of the caliphate under al-Ma&#39;m?n (809-33) after a decade-long civil war. Y�cesoy challenges traditional sociological views that marginalize messianic beliefs as oppositional ideologies of disfranchised social classes to be used against the political establishment. Instead he finds a mode of symbiosis between messianic beliefs, political reform, and imperial ambitions put in motion by al-Ma&#39;m?n&#39;s acute understanding of the sociopolitical and ideological context of his time. Y�cesoy demonstrates how the caliphate absorbed influences from the late antique world and Near Eastern cultures to fashion a prophetic vision that served to undergird al-Ma&#39;m?n&#39;s imperial aspirations. A comprehensive portrait of the caliph and his reign emerges from this study as a result. By drawing on records of Muslim and non-Muslim apocalyptic prophecies circulating among the general public and educated elites alike, this study demonstrates the pertinence of messianic beliefs to medieval Muslim politics and illustrates the manner in which the caliph responded and shaped societal concerns on three distinct fronts: domestic fiscal and administrative reforms, an increase in missionary and military activities, and religious reform. Y�cesoy shows that political usefulness contributed to the longevity of charismatic ideologies by addressing how the &#39;Abb?sid ruling class adopted such beliefs as a medium to initiate governmental reforms and expand their authority. This work adds new layers to ongoing interdisciplinary discourse about the importance of religion in Islamic sociopolitical life, both historically and in the contemporary Muslim world.</p><p>An analysis of the dynamic relationship between apocalyptic prophesies and medieval Muslim politicsHayrettin Y�cesoy is an assistant professor of history at Saint Louis University, the author of The Development of Sunni Political Thought: The Formative Period, and coauthor of The Mediterranean World of the Middle Ages.</p><h2>Dynamics of Difference in Australia: Indigenous Past and Present in a Settler Country</h2><p><p>In <i>Dynamics of Difference in Australia</i>, Francesca Merlan examines relations between indigenous and nonindigenous people from the events of early exploration and colonial endeavors to the present day. From face-to-face interactions to national and geopolitical affairs, the book illuminates the dimensions of difference that are revealed by these encounters: what indigenous and nonindigenous people pay attention to, what they value, what preconceived notions each possesses, and what their responses are to the Other. Basing her analysis on her extensive fieldwork in northern Australia, Merlan highlights the asymmetries in the exchanges between the settler majority and the indigenous minority, looking at everything from forms of violence and material transactions, to indigenous involvement in resource development, to governmental intervention in indigenous affairs.</p><p>Merlan frames the book within the current debate in Australian society concerning the constitutional recognition of indigenous people by the nation-state. Surveying the precursors to this question and its continuing and unresolved nature, she chronicles the ways in which an indigenous minority can remain culturally different while simultaneously experiencing the transformative forces of domination, constraint, and inequality. Conducting an investigation of long-term change against the backdrop of a highly salient and timely public debate surrounding indigenous issues, <i>Dynamics of Difference</i> has far-reaching implications both for public policy and for current theoretical debates about the nature of sociocultural continuity and change.</p></p><p>Francesca Merlan is Professor of Anthropology at Australian National University. She is author of numerous books, including Caging the Rainbow: Places, Politics, and Aborigines in a North Australian Town.<p>Preface<br>Region, Position, and Ethics of Representation</p><p>This book is about relationships between indigenous and nonindigenous people in Australia at different points in time and especially about "differences" as detectable and active in those relationships. I take differences to be identifiable forms of being in common, together with some sense of commonly shared values, that contrast with other forms similarly held in common by "others." The aim in each following chapter is to explore kinds of difference and the extent to which difference has served as a mode or pathway of engagement or a delimiting boundary, in the first place between indigenous and nonindigenous actors but subsequently in ways that make those categories more complex and more directly contested. The book's aim is not to examine "culture/s" as if entirely separate but to examine what we understand as cultural by considering difference in indigenous-nonindigenous engagement and its implications. I have found it plausible and indeed illuminating to consider differences over long time spans, so the material in this book moves between moments of early indigenous-nonindigenous encounter and the present.</p><p>Many nonindigenous people in southern Australia say that they infrequently meet and do not know any indigenous people. That this is possible is some indication of the relatively peripheral position and small proportion of indigenous people and communities in urban and especially southeastern Australia. Like many who set out to do research with indigenous communities, my intention on coming to Australia was to go north, where indigenous people constitute a much larger proportion of the population and it is unlikely that one would not "see" them. Seeing is different from getting to know, and in this Preface I set out the conditions in which I came to know Australia's north and became involved in the indigenous-nonindigenous relations this book explores.</p><p>The book is concerned with historicity but is also ethnographic, based partly on my own ethnographic research, as well as on my search to win ethnographic insights from historical material. The link between ethnography and analysis in the book raises two issues that need to be addressed here. The first is what is nowadays often called in the human sciences "positionality"&#x2014;the call for us as researchers and authors to reflect on our own position in relation to the people we write about, focusing on issues of relative privilege and our ethical responsibility to avoid exploitative research. The other is the matter of "relationship." The book is about indigenous-nonindigenous relationships, and this account focuses on relationships I came to have with indigenous people and communities over time.</p><p>I came from the United States in 1976 to take up a three-year research fellowship in the Top End of the Northern Territory of Australia. I had never been in Australia before. What made me think I could arrive and do this kind of research? I had some personal preparation and inclination. As a child I had spent periods of time in North American Indian communities in which Indians were the majority, and as a Ph.D. student I had done research in communities where relations between Indians and outsiders were marked by a high degree of physical and social separation, but influences from dominant North American society were also pervasive. Both of these things are true of northern Australia too. There had been in my family history some relationships with indigenous people in northern New Mexico where I was born, and I felt a continuing interest in those Native American settings that seemed as interesting as others I knew, including that of the first-generation Italian immigrants in Brooklyn on my father's side of the family with whom I also spent much of my childhood. I cannot, however, recall any personal feeling of nostalgia for traditional lifeworlds other than the ones I found around me (cf. Rosaldo 1989). But I did have a sense from early on of different social milieus, their uprooting and reconfiguration. At the time I set out for northern Australia, I had few specific preconceptions about what life would be like there or the character of relationships between indigenous and nonindigenous people. An entire framework of supported academic research made it all possible.</p><p>I had applied for and been granted a research fellowship from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra, the national capital, to investigate the changing locations and languages of indigenous people in an area of considerable social diversity, three hundred kilometers southeast of Darwin, the Northern Territory's capital. The town of Katherine was the supply center and focus of the region for both indigenous and nonindigenous people, inhabited by about five thousand people when I arrived. A number of Aborigines in the town had long lived there, but they had become a minority among the Aboriginal population as new arrivals came in and stayed, mostly on the town's fringes. Several hundred Aboriginal people were camping on the fringes, many of them recently displaced by changes in the conditions of rural work. Some of these communities were expelled by pastoralists and/or fragmented as Aboriginal people came to be more fully included in an economy of government welfare benefits.</p><p><br>Unknown to me, changes were being set in train in the relations between Aboriginal people and other Australians that were to shape much of my activity for years to come. The biggest was the Australian Parliament passing the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act in 1976, enabling Aboriginal people to claim traditional ownership of territory they regarded as theirs. This law was the product of years of activism by and on behalf of indigenous people, mainly taking place in Australia's urban centers but imaginatively stimulated by remote Australia. Land rights were politically possible on a large scale only in the Northern Territory because as a territory rather than a state it was under the direct control and jurisdiction of the federal government. By the 1970s federal government endorsement of land rights was bipartisan (unlike in the Northern Territory itself, where there was widespread opposition among the non-Aboriginal people who by then composed a majority of the population there).</p><p>From Katherine, I also became familiar and lived in some outlying indigenous communities, two of which especially figure in following chapters: Barunga, seventy kilometers southeast of Katherine on the Central Arnhem Road (then largely unpaved, now paved); and Jilgmirn.gan (locally usually spelled Jilkminggan) on Elsey Station about 114 kilometers south and east of Katherine on the Roper Highway. A range of other towns, town fringe camps, stations (ranches), and other locations interconnected with these were all places I spent time, partly because interlinked kindreds whom I came to know lived in a range of different places (see Figure 1). Communities like Barunga (and Beswick to the northeast) had been established or reconfigured in the postwar period, with the administrative intention that Aboriginal people could be contained there and kept away from town. Others like Jilgmirn.gan on Elsey were long-term station communities, places of settlement reconfigured on pastoral properties where Aboriginal people were living on small excision areas of the homelands of at least some members of the community. Many of these station communities had been much larger until around the time of implementation of the minimum wage, phased in from 1966 to 1968, when they were turned off many of those properties or discouraged from living there. The new conditions meant that pastoralists were unwilling to accept the continuing residence of numbers of indigenous people. Indigenous camps on some stations were now greatly reduced or only seasonally occupied. Others like Jilgmirn.gan on Elsey&#x2014;not too far from the small town of Mataranka (about thirty kilometers), in the homeland of most camp residents and familiar to others married in or present for other reasons&#x2014;continued to hold their populations.</p><p>I received mixed but generally welcoming treatment from indigenous people in the various living situations I got to know, through links of kinship and shared experience among members of the various camps and settlements. My becoming "adopted" shortly after my arrival as a "granddaughter" to two principal women in two different camps in Katherine provided a framework and transferrable elements of recognizability for my receptions elsewhere; this, I came to understand, was the genius of indigenous regionalism, its network-like character and tensile strength (Chapter 5). These elements structured the kin identity I could be assigned in new locations and, on a personal level, my reception by particular people. My hosts and their families welcomed my interest in where they had come from, their languages, their connections to home territories. Many spent considerable time involving themselves in our shared travels, recordings of language, biographical, and story material of all kinds. In part, this was because some people (of those who had been displaced) harbored desires to return to where they had come from, but not all did. Nor did all see the recording of this material as something relevant to the future of their own families and people: "It will be good for white people, not for my family," one man memorably said. Alongside these research concerns I became very involved with how indigenous people were managing in their present, and in this we made considerable common cause.</p><p>I spent at least two years (1976-78) in the north before the Northern Land Council asked me to be involved in a land claim over a spectacular national park, the site of Katherine Gorge and River, considered by local (nonindigenous) townspeople to be the premier attraction of the Katherine region, and a centerpiece of the regional economy. I therefore had a clear idea how contentious this case would be. Nonindigenous townspeople were worried that indigenous ownership of the park would exclude them. They were worried about the effect on tourism. No favorable public view had yet formed concerning the possible tourist values of indigenous presence and ownership; that was to come only later.</p><p>The people I was getting to know had been enormously changed by colonization, from around the 1880s, when gold mining began around Pine Creek (and with lesser intensity, near the growing town of Katherine) and pastoral properties (ranches) were taken up and stocked where environmental conditions seemed favorable (and even where they did not, leading to repeated failures). Indigenous people had moved to these places of settler colonial occupation&#x2014;mines, towns, pastoral stations. As well, they had been subject to large-scale exterminatory violence arising from settler occupation during what many older indigenous people recalled as "killing times," or sometimes "wild times." Indigenous people who "came in" to pastoral properties from the colonially appropriated bush remade their lives there but were affected by continuing violence, disease, and eventually, by concentration in army camps during the Second World War.</p><p>These experiences gave rise to differences among indigenous people in their relations among themselves and in their relations to white people. Those who had lived as the labor force on (especially larger, continuous) pastoral properties tended to have a greater sense of cohesion among themselves (a context of parts of Chapters 5 and 6) and had found white bosses to whose predictable expectations they had learned to accommodate; while those who had lived in the mining fields tended to have experienced continuing exposure to volatile and changing work regimes, substance abuse (opium, methylated spirits, alcohol), and sexual exploitation (Chapter 6). Somewhat different kinds of personalities were to be found within these sets of people.</p><p>After World War II, some resided in the government settlements or communities established to contain them, others returned to outlying pastoral properties whence they had come, and still others, often illicitly, lived on the fringes of regional towns. There was movement among all these locations in Aboriginal walkabouts, which became ever less common. Aboriginal presence around towns was prohibited to all but officially employed Aborigines until 1948. Alcohol was prohibited to them until 1964, and paternalistic employment situations of low or no wages, with some keep, were common until 1968. Their influx into regional towns began as nationwide union activism resulted in the implementation of a minimum wage. Pastoralists had warned that wage parity would result in Aboriginal people being turned off cattle stations. Exploitation of indigenous labor, according to Patrick Wolfe (1999:27), was a "contradiction, rather than an inherent component" of replacive and tendentially eliminatory settler colonialism (although see McGrath 1987 for an important qualification to this view). Indeed, pastoralists rapidly replaced indigenous labor with technologies; as well, they began to employ indigenous workers casually.</p><p>The nonindigenous people of Katherine had made little or no provision for the fringe-dwelling Aborigines, and, with few exceptions, they repudiated the fringe dwellers for being who they were and for the squalor of their conditions. Many indigenous people in the postwar settlements built to contain them had nevertheless begun to orient more regularly toward towns as sources of supply and because of the increasing Aboriginal social intensity there. Administrative moves began to gain tenure for camps and to give the residents basic services. Their increasing access to cash (wages and the monetization of welfare) and the removal of controls on their access to alcohol in 1964 had contributed to their becoming a troubling presence in town. Legal purchase of alcohol had been symbolically coded by some Aborigines as achieved "citizenship" (see Sansom 1980), but alcohol undoubtedly became an enormous medical and social burden on Aboriginal people and communities, and it has remained so. The nonindigenous town's negative image of Aborigines as fringe dwellers contrasted with more romantic and traditional imagery prevalent in urban Australia. Northern white Australians, on the other hand, felt their understanding of northern conditions to be far superior to that of nescient southerners. The prospect of "traditional ownership" of the beautiful Katherine Gorge national park, as far as most townspeople were concerned, was incompatible with the region's developed tourism. Aboriginal ownership would only impede tourism, and their presence would spoil town amenity.</p><p>As I spent most of my time with Aboriginal people living around the town, camping in fringe locations, I noticed many things that have stayed with me ever since. Most obvious was the woefulness of their fringe-camp living conditions. Indigenous people were vulnerable to exploitation. Shortly after I arrived, a woman limped into a fringe camp where I had become a regular visitor and part-time resident some kilometers out of town. She needed to recuperate from having been abducted (evidently lured with alcohol), driven away, and raped by several white workers who were haunting Aborigina...</p></p><h2>Teach Yourself VISUALLY Web Design (Teach Yourself VISUALLY (Tech))</h2><p><b>The mechanics of Web design made easy for visual learners</b> <p>An effective Web site combines good graphic design principles with a functional user interface.

As the population requiring healthcare increases, so does the room for error and the demand for patient-centered care. The health system, focused on procedures, protocols, technology, and lower costs, continues to inflict unnecessary harms upon already vulnerable patients and their families. Nurses, as the largest group of health care professionals that spend the longest time with patients and families, are in a unique position to advance new relationship-centric approaches to health care. This text focuses on the practical application of the Quality Caring Model, featuring new examples of ways to embed caring into the health care environment. An abundance of practice analyses and reflective exercises reinforce the book&#x2019;s content.</p><p>Written for nursing students, clinicians, educators, and leaders, this text delves into the intricacies of relational health care. Chapters apply the model to patients and families and provide optimal learning strategies to inform quality-caring competencies. Case studies, interviews, exemplars, relevant lessons, and suggested improvements woven throughout the text push the model further than theory and into practice.</p><p><strong>New to the Third Edition:</strong></p><ul><li>Updates and clarifies the Quality Caring Model to improve the safety and quality of health systems</li><li>Examines the continuing quality crisis in health care</li><li>Demonstrates the model&#x2019;s application in clinical, educational, and leadership practice</li><li>Includes practice analyses at the end of each chapter</li><li>Discusses how nurses can work in creative ways to implement caring in their practice as per IOM Future of Nursing Report</li><li>Provides interviews with practicing nurses reflecting the challenges and strategies needed to implement caring in our technopharmacological system</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Examines the evolution of the Quality Caring Model, its key concepts, and the clinical, educational, and leadership implications for application</li><li>Features interviews with practicing nurses that reflect challenges and successful strategies</li><li>Includes case studies and practical insights from diverse community and academic health centers</li><li>Includes learning objectives, boxed calls to action, key summary points and reflective exercises</li><li>Offers user-friendly visual images and charts</li><li>Focuses on the challenge of creating value</li><li>Facilitates Magnet designation</li></ul></p><p>&#34;I enjoyed the book.

His works include collections of fairy stories; the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray; and many brilliantly witty plays, including what is often considered to be his masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest.&#39;Paranormal activity at Wilde&#39;s Canterville. When it comes to handling ghosts, the characters in Oscar Wilde&#39;s The Canterville Ghost (in a new recording from Naxos AudioBooks) are far bolder than Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. When Marley&#39;s ghost comes rattling his chains, you may remember, the old miser drops his gruffness in the face of his old associate&#39;s awful warnings. Not Wilde&#39;s Hiram B. Otis, an &#39;American minister&#39; who purchases an English country house and moves in with his family despite dire warnings that it is haunted. The ghost, Sir Simon Canterville - who&#39;s been scaring the daylights out of the house&#39;s inhabitants since his death in 1584 - wastes no time in mounting a haunt. In the dead of night, Otis hears chains clanking in the halls and beholds an awful sight: Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man of terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair fell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of antique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles and rusty gyves. &#39;My dear sir,&#39; said Mr. Otis, &#39;I really must insist on your oiling those chains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator.&#39; Oiling those chains! Rupert Degas is pitch-perfect in the Naxos recording -quite a departure from some of his previous Naxos recordings, including Cormac McCarthy&#39;s The Road and Kafka&#39;s The Trial. The grimness and desperation of those stories is far from the desperation Sir Simon faces with the Otises. No matter what he does, he can&#39;t bloody well scare them! The couple&#39;s twins boys hit him in the knees with pea-shooters, and, when Mrs. Otis hears the ghost&#39;s terrible laugh, her reaction is: &#39;I am afraid you are far from well ... and have brought you a bottle of Dr. Dobell&#39;s tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a most excellent remedy.&#39;� � Degas captures the nasally voices of the Americans (for Wilde, Americans are the ones with the accents) and Sir Simon&#39;s exasperated harrumphs - which turn, later, into sighs of relief as somebody finally pities him: the Otises&#39; daughter, Virginia. Degas gives listeners a hilarious performance that&#39;s an ideal antidote for the shivers if you&#39;ve seen Paranormal Activity.&#39; - Nick Owchar, Los Angeles Times &#39;British actor Degas&#39; gift for accents and flair for the dramatic make him an excellent choice to read Wilde&#39;s beloved gothic ghost story set in Great Britain. A ghost has been haunting residents at Canterville Chase for centuries. But these poltergeist powers seem lost on the Otis family from America. Degas&#39; reading is lively, brisk, and laced with just the right amount of foreboding, and he subtly raises pitch during suspenseful moments. Degas gives Mr. Otis the deep, monotone, matter-of-fact tenor of a dull diplomat, while he portrays Mrs. Otis, a Manhattan socialite, in a much higher register, pretentious and pinched. The ghost, frustrated and world-weary over failure to frighten, is appropriately raspy and guttural. Each chapter is introduced by classical music and abundant sound effects - rattling chains, creaking floorboards, thunder and lightning - to greatly enhance the mood. Perfect for a dark and stormy night.&#39; - Allison Block, Booklist Anyone who is only familiar with the old Margaret O&#39;Brien and Charles Laughton movie version or one of the more recent versions of The Canterville Ghost will enjoy meeting the Otises and the ghostly Sir Simon as Wilde actually envisioned them. When the American Minister to the court of St. James purchases Canterville Chase and is warned of the ghost, he declines to believe in it and says he will &#39;take the furniture and the ghost at evaluation.&#39; As Sir Simon proceeds to haunt (and he has fearsomely haunted before) he comes to believe in him, but he and his family will brook no nonsense. They give him something to oil his noisy chains. The twin sons bedevil him, and the daughter takes pity on him. Rupert Degas is an excellent narrator with his fine cultured British voice as the present Lord Canterville, the past Sir Simon, and with a pretty good set of American accents for all members of the Otis family, male and female - This is such fun to hear the authentic and brilliant Wilde and it is very enjoyable family listening for all ages. - Mary Purucker, SoundCommentary.com</p><h2>Immortality: The Inevitability of Eternal Life</h2><p>In this revolutionary, thought-provoking book, Kabbalist Rav Berg dares to take on a subject long considered taboo by medical and scientific establishments - immortality. And that the ultimate &#39;getting&#39; of Kabbalah is really getting eternal life. Some of the greatest Kabbalists never died. Drawing upon the personal story of his own journey towards spiritual enlightenment, Rav Berg shares compelling kabbalistic insights into the origins of death, and the spiritual tools necessary for its final disappearance from the world. This is the remarkable story about how one of the greatest Kabbalists of this century got Kabbalah. This deeply felt memoir illuminates Rav Berg&#39;s relationship with his master, the great Kabbalist Rabbi Yehuda Brandwein, as well as the growth of The Kabbalah Centre, the world&#39;s largest organisation dedicated to spreading the wisdom of Kabbalah.</p><p></p><h2>Evolving Brains (Scientific American Library)</h2><p>How did the human brain with all its manifold capacities evolve from basic functions in simple organisms that lived nearly a billion years ago? John Allman addresses this question in Evolving Brains, a provocative study of brain evolution that introduces readers to some of the most exciting developments in science in recent years. Evolving Brains integrates a multiplicity of evolutionary developments involving genetics, response to climate variations, social organization, the nervous system, environment, and behavior. By providing one of the clearest maps yet of the brain&#39;s long and eventful journey through time, Evolving Brains reveals a more complete picture of who we are and where we come from.</p><p>What's the big deal about big brains? They're a costly enhancement, says neurobiologist John Allman in <i>Evolving Brains</i>. "Animals with big brains are rare," he stresses. "If brains enable animals to adapt to changing environments, why is it that so few animals have large brains? The reason is that big brains are very expensive." He examines the whys and wherefores of large-brain evolution, and draws out the connections between large brains and long lives; shows why major evolutionary advances are often made by small predators; makes you appreciate why mammals, burdened by the cost of warm-bloodedness, were unable to unseat the dinosaurs; and more. So, while large brains such as the ones we humans enjoy may give survival advantages to individuals, some species have done (and did) just fine for millions of years with pea brains. <p> Rather than talking only about cells, circuits, neurotransmitters, and genes, or gliding up to the ethereal regions of psychology and philosophy, Allman looks at the whole organism--the "middle-sized, middle-distanced objects," as Willard Van Orman Quine said. <i>Evolving Brains</i> is full of interesting scientific tidbits, only rarely becoming tangled in the thicket of jargon. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><b>John Morgan Allman</b> is Hixon Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology. He received his doctoral degree in anthropology and played a key role in the discovery that the visual cortex in primates comprises many areas that serve a multitude of functions.

Marxism has also been a political program designed to show how these inevitable changes could be hastened. Richard Schmitt argues that Marxian predictions are ambiguous and unreliable, adding that the political program is vitiated by serious ambiguities in the conceptions of class and of political and social transformations. Marxism remains of importance, however, because it is the major source of criticisms of capitalism and its associated social and political institutions. We must understand such criticisms if we are to understand our own world and live in it effectively. While very critical of the failures of Marx and Engels, this book offers a sympathetic account of their criticism of capitalism and their visions of a better world, mentions some interpretive controversies, and connects the questions raised by Marx and Engels to contemporary disputes to show continuity between social thought in the middle of the last century and today.Addressed to undergraduate students, the book is easily accessible. It will be important in introductory or middle-level courses in sociology, political theory, critical theory of literature or law. It will also be useful in graduate courses in political theory, sociology, and economics.</p><p><b>Richard Schmitt</b> is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Brown University.

In this classic work, Martha Nussbaum maintains that these Hellenistic schools have been unjustly neglected in recent philosophic accounts of what the classical "tradition" has to offer. By examining texts of philosophers such as Epicurus, Lucretius, and Seneca, she recovers a valuable source for current moral and political thought and encourages us to reconsider philosophical argument as a technique through which to improve lives. Written for general readers and specialists, <i>The Therapy of Desire</i> addresses compelling issues ranging from the psychology of human passion through rhetoric to the role of philosophy in public and private life.</p></p><p><br> <p>"Filled with many beautifully written and powerful passages, this book will provoke lively discussion among specialists and show nonspecialists how much there is to be gained from a serious study of this period."<b>--Brad Inwood, University of Toronto</b><br> </p><br><b>Martha C.

The resulting volume reflects the significant and exciting advances that have been made in these fields since the editors&#39; acclaimed volume, General Relativity: An Einstein Centenary Survey (CUP 1979). Newton&#39;s immense contribution to the physical sciences is assessed, and its relevance to today&#39;s physics made clear. The international group of contributors then chart the major developments in the study of gravitation, from Newtonian gravity to black hole physics. In the fields of galaxy formation, inflationary and quantum cosmology, and superstring unification, the book provides important overviews written by workers involved in the many advances described. By shaping such a wide-ranging and scholarly series of articles into a cohesive whole, the editors have created a fitting and lasting memorial to the man who continues to inspire scientists the world over.</p><p>A collection of reviews by prominent researchers in cosmology, relativity and particle physics commemorates the 300th anniversary of Newton&#39;s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica."...the papers in this collection show us that it [the study of gravitation] is exciting, provocative and stimulating..."

Written to be understood by readers without proper scientific training, the main features of scientific method are illustrated by the use of case histories of research and discovery. The book also explores such questions as the nature of scientific understanding of the world, how theories are invented, how they are tested experimentally, and whether the scientist is ever "objective."The broad scientific experience of Martin and Inge Goldstein has made them aware not only of the distinctive features of diverse disciplines, but also of the common ground all fields of science share. This book was written in the belief that these common features of the scientific enterprise can be communicated to the nonscientist, and that it is important both for science and for society as a whole that this be done.<i>How We Know</i> offers help to those mystified and confused by the methods and aims of science. It firmly establishes science as a product of human beings acting in human ways, a process where the search for beauty can be as compelling as the search for truth.</p><p><b>Martin Goldstein (1919-2014),</b> former Professor of Chemistry at Yeshiva University, and <b>Inge F.

Much more than a do-it-yourself magic manual, this guide to the craft emphasizes the responsibilities and ethical issues that are part of the magical life. <br> <br>Spellcaster addresses the theoretical and practical background of magic-exploring how magical energies operate and manifest. The seven essays represent different approaches and traditions-including Wicca, Hermetic Magick, Northern traditions, and freeform Natural Magick. The wisdom collected here is meant to inspire and empower beginners and less experienced magic users, so they may go on to safely and confidently customize their own magical practice. <br></p><p>Martin lives on the south coast of Sussex, in the south of England, with his partner, Dan, and his Jack Russell, Lucy. &nbsp;Although he is essentially a solitary practitioner at heart, he runs a small coven that practices its craft at sacred sites in the Sussex countryside <br> Elen Hawke is a practicing witch who lives in Oxford &nbsp;with her husband and a house full of animals. &nbsp;She also has two grown children. &nbsp;Elen is a photographer and illustrator, and has been doing professional astrology for 27 years and tarot reading for 10. &nbsp;She divides her time between healing and teaching witchcraft, meditation, and chakra work. &nbsp;She is Wiccan initiate in the Gardnerian tradition, a Circlework graduate from the House of the Goddess, and a member of the Pagan Federation. <br> <br>Elen is of Irish, Welsh, Anglo-Saxon, and Jewish ancestry. &nbsp;She remembers having psychic experiences since youth, and feeling an intense connection to the natural world. &nbsp;Her love for reading began early with her grandmother's books on natural history and Greek mythology. <br> <br>Elen has traveled through and lived in many other lands, including Iran, Afghanistan, and Brittany. &nbsp;She believes that this cultural exposure and appreciation made the transition to Paganism easier for her than many. &nbsp;She describes her spirituality as "eclectic," having explored Spiritualism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Druidry as well as Wicca. &nbsp;She has achieved both the Bardic and Ovate grades in the Druid path. <br> <br>Elen runs the email discussion group witchcraft_uk on behalf of the Children of Artemis. <br> ~Song of the Star <br> <br>LEAH WHITEHORSE <br> <br><i>When I first began walking </i>the witch&#x2019;s path I was oblivious to the whys and <br>wherefores of spells. They were something belonging to the dark horror <br>movies of my teenage years, the pages of storybooks and fairy tales. <br> <br>Spells were about power, seduction, control, and perfection. Of course I <br>was utterly fascinated, a little scared, and completely clueless. My first <br>&#x201c;proper&#x201d; spell involved the obligatory unrequited love situation. I found <br>a spell printed in some antiquarian booklet, diligently followed everything <br>by the letter, chanted my chant, and got my man . . . for one night <br>only, after which I was ceremoniously dropped from a great height whilst <br>the Goddess giggled in the background. I came to know this as my first <br>spiritual handslapping. <br> <br>The partial success of my crafting inspired me, whereas its demise <br>frustrated and disappointed me. Not only did I feel let down by the poor <br>guy in question, but I felt utterly betrayed by spirit. The success led me <br>to feel that there was something to all this magic stuff; the failure led me <br>to question why. <br> <br>Looking back at this situation, I realise that this was the beginning of <br>my journey toward understanding the nature of magic. I pondered what <br>I had done to change the fabric of the universe and bend it to my will. I <br>feared retribution, questioned my motivation and intent, raged at the <br>skies, and cried into my pillow. Somewhere there was an &#x201c;answer,&#x201d; and I <br>was determined to find it. <br> <br>My dream life has always been vivid, and it was the nature and laws of <br>the dreamscape that would eventually tutor me in the ways of magical <br>practice. Spirits, Guides, and ancient gods populated my dreams from <br>early on, and often my magical inspirations and understandings have <br>been triggered by my nightly wanderings. I experienced lucid dreams as <br>a child, and for a long time I didn&#x2019;t differentiate between that reality and <br>the one of the waking world, despite being told the difference by others. <br>My dreams were simply &#x201c;my other life,&#x201d; just as real and meaningful as the <br>everyday world. I quickly learned that I could fly at will and manipulate <br>the scenery to my own design. It was this latter curious ability that really <br>caught my attention, as I had an inkling of recognition that this in some <br>way related to the structure of the waking world. I noticed that sometimes <br>I could dissolve or transform the monsters and demons that <br>haunted me, and other times I could not. I questioned why. <br> <br>In my early twenties I began to work with astral projection/out-ofbody <br>experiences triggered by sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming. These <br>journeys provided further food for thought from Guides and other entities <br>that dwell in the astral worlds who put up with my childlike endless <br>questioning and occasionally granted me glimpses of the greater pattern. <br>What I offer here is my understanding of the process of magic and <br>how it shapes and changes us when we choose to cast spells. I have a firm <br>belief that whatever spiritual path we follow, each step along the way <br>needs to be matched with personal development. By &#x201c;personal development&#x201d; <br>I mean the process of delving into the far reaches of the mind to <br>understand why we act, think, feel, and respond as we do. The magical <br>path is one that increases and demands self-awareness. <br> <br>I have a particular view of reality and ways of working that I wish to <br>share with you. I do not profess to know the truth, for we each hold our <br>own individual truths. Instead I offer what I have learned so far on the <br>journey in the hope that it will facilitate you on your own magical path <br>and inspire you to seek greater meaning as to what magic means to you. <br>I rarely perform actual spells nowadays&#x2014;that is, if you define a spell as <br>using the various tools and paraphernalia available. Yet I live a magical life <br>in which I notice the great web unfolding and changing endlessly with my <br>thoughts. I am in awe of how the universe is constantly in communication <br>with us and how the Goddess hears my whispers on the wind.<br></p><h2>The Winner&#39;s Guide to Optimist Sailing</h2><p><p>Written by one of the best-known figures in all of sailing and a leading authority on Optimist sailing and racing, <i>The Winner's Guide to Optimist Sailing </i>is the ideal training manual for young skippers, their parents, and their coaches.

At that moment, the amateur detective hero was undergoing some substantial formulaic revision and was being split into two different narrative directions.</p><p>The first of these narrative directions landed in the gothic supernatural genre, where the amateur detective became the amateur occult detective. The early source of this transformational development began in the work of the Irish-born gothic writer Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, in his collection of tales <i>In a Glass Darkly</i> (1872), published as the posthumous files of the fictitious occult investigator Dr. Martin Hesselius. Irish author Bram Stoker sculpted Le Fanu&#x2019;s reflective Dr. Hesselius into a fearless vampire killer in his novel <i>Dracula</i> (1897), which features an occult professor named Abraham Van Helsing, who functions as Stoker&#x2019;s rational voice in the story by explaining and justifying the supernatural powers of Dracula both to other characters and to the reader. English writer Algernon Blackwood continued this trend in <i>John Silence, Physician Extraordinary</i> (1908), a short story collection containing an assortment of tales that highlight a consulting occult physician as an interconnected framing device for the stories. British-born William Hope Hodgson contributed his own version of the ghost hunter in his collection <i>Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder</i> (1913), thus completing the conversion of Conan Doyle&#x2019;s pragmatic, hyper-rational amateur detective into the &#x201c;supernatural sleuth.&#x201d; This character type continued through the twentieth century in the American pulp fiction magazines to the contemporary writers of urban fantasy, arguably reaching its cultural zenith in the comic mode with the 1980s film franchise <i>Ghostbusters</i>, and remaining popular today in films like <i>The Conjuring</i>.</p><p>The second narrative direction resulted in the creation of the gentleman thief protagonist, a culmination of the hero-turned-villain. Indeed, as reader interest heightened through the second half of the nineteenth century for the villain-as-protagonist, the brilliant sleuth who made fools of the professional police was no longer the detective hero, but instead the gentleman thief. While the late-Victorian occult detective was essentially a product of Irish and British writers, the gentleman thief possessed a French readership in addition to a British and American audience. The most important of the French gentleman thief protagonists was Ars�ne Lupin, penned by the prolific French novelist Maurice Leblanc, while the most famous, or infamous, of these British and American gentleman thief protagonists included Grant Allen&#x2019;s Colonel Clay, E. W. Hornung&#x2019;s Raffles, Frederick Irving Anderson&#x2019;s Infallible Godahl, and, of course, Guy Boothby&#x2019;s Simon Carne.</p><p>The origins of the gentleman thief protagonist in popular crime fiction began in a series of interconnected short stories featuring the master crook Colonel Clay, written by author Grant Allen and appearing in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> from June 1896 through May 1897. These stories were later collected in a book entitled <i>An African Millionaire</i>, published in 1897, interestingly the same year that Bram Stoker&#x2019;s <i>Dracula</i> appeared. Canadian-born Grant Allen (1848&#x2013;1899) began a career as a full-time writer in 1876. Most of his early work was in the sciences, but he eventually turned to writing fiction, and between 1884 and 1899 he wrote prolifically. The only novel (or more correctly, collection of interconnected short stories) Allen wrote that continues to be read today is <i>An African Millionaire</i>. His seminal character, Colonel Clay, in addition to being a gentleman thief, was also a master of disguise (hence his professional sobriquet). He could alter his face and manners at will, fooling both the authorities and his intended target, Sir Charles Vandrift. Sir Charles, the reader quickly learns, is the African millionaire of the book&#x2019;s title, an obtuse man housing the capitalistic character faults of greed and stupidity, faults that, of course, left him at the mercy of the trickster Colonel Clay. Each short story in the series recounted a new scheme of Clay&#x2019;s to relieve Vandrift of his great wealth, employing disguise and Vandrift&#x2019;s greedy ambition to his successful advantage. Colonel Clay was a robber stealing from a &#x201c;robber baron&#x201d; figure, in essence stealing from one who steals from others.</p><p>British-born Ernest William Hornung (1866&#x2013;1921), a literary contemporary of Grant Allen&#x2019;s in England, was a successful and prolific writer of gaslight-era melodrama and thrillers. He began his writing career as a journalist and a poet, and then later became a popular novelist. Though the majority of Hornung&#x2019;s literary efforts are forgotten today, the adventures of his gentleman thief protagonist, A. J. Raffles, continue to be read (and imitated in a number of pastiches by authors such as Graham Greene, Peter Tremayne, and Barry Perowne). Raffles appeared in three collections of short stories&#x2014;<i>The Amateur Cracksman</i> (1899), <i>The Black Mask</i> (1901), and <i>A Thief in the Night</i> (1905)&#x2014;as well as in one novel, <i>Mr. Justice Raffles</i> (1909). During the course of his ten-year career in crime, Raffles evolved from an &#x201c;amateur&#x201d; thief, to a professional thief, to a war hero who dies in battle during the Boer War. Hornung intended to kill off Raffles at the conclusion of <i>The Black Mask</i>, but reader demand seemingly compelled Hornung to resurrect his popular gentleman thief in the novel <i>Mr. Justice Raffles</i>, a story set before the Boer War. Raffles is thus similar to Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes: both characters appeared to be killed by their creators, and then were brought back to life for additional adventures by the influence of their distraught readers when economic pressure was exerted on the authors. However, unlike Raffles, who remained buried the second time around, Sherlock Holmes was revealed not to have perished at the conclusion of the tale &#x201c;The Final Problem&#x201d; and&#x2014;following the interlude of a previous adventure recorded in <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>&#x2014;reappeared alive and healthy in the story &#x201c;The Adventure of the Empty House.&#x201d;</p><p>George Orwell saw a certain virtue in Raffles. In his essay &#x201c;Raffles and Miss Blandish,&#x201d; Orwell offers a comparison between the Raffles stories by E. W. Hornung and the James Hadley Chase novel <i>No Orchids for Miss Blandish</i> (1939). The latter does not compare favorably in Orwell&#x2019;s view, because it embraces the &#x201c;sadistic&#x201d; and &#x201c;masochistic&#x201d; elements found in the American pulp magazines of that era, even though Chase was a British author writing for a British audience enduring the London Blitz. Specifically, Orwell objects to the morally equivocal representation of crime in the story, where &#x201c;being a criminal is only reprehensible in the sense that it does not pay.&#x201d; The police employ criminal methods in Chase&#x2019;s novel, Orwell explains, so that there is little moral difference between crook and cop. Orwell states: &#x201c;This is a new departure for English sensational fiction, in which till recently there has always been a sharp distinction between right and wrong and a general agreement that virtue must triumph in the last chapter.&#x201d; Indeed, Raffles, along with many of the gentleman crooks and con artists coexisting with Hornung&#x2019;s creation, decidedly avoided the hearty strain of violence typically found in the British pulp fiction periodicals of the period, as well as in the nineteenth-century American dime novels and early twentieth-century pulp magazines that featured crime fiction.</p><p>While Grant Allen&#x2019;s Colonel Clay and E. W. Hornung&#x2019;s Raffles plundered England&#x2019;s elite, Frederick Irving Anderson&#x2019;s Infallible Godahl was the only significant American gentleman thief to appear in crime fiction in the years prior to World War I. Perhaps an American audience was less inclined to accept a morally ambivalent American protagonist in crime fiction, while simultaneously having no difficulty in reading the adventures of British and French gentleman thieves. No doubt the American readership perceived the older European culture as being more decadent, and subsequently was inclined to accept their rogues and thieves as heroes. Anderson&#x2019;s Infallible Godahl was featured in just six stories published in the so-called slick periodical <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> from 1913 to 1914, which were subsequently collected in a single volume entitled <i>The Adventures of the Infallible Godahl</i> in 1914. Though relatively unknown to today&#x2019;s reader, during his lifetime, American-born Frederick Irving Anderson (1877&#x2013;1947) was one of the more popular authors of thriller and detective fiction to appear in <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>. He wrote extensively and successfully for the slick magazine markets, publishing more than fifty stories in <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> alone. He published only three volumes of crime fiction: <i>The Adventures of the Infallible Godahl</i> (1914), <i>The Notorious Sophie Lang</i> (1925), and <i>The Book of Murder</i> (1930), which the mystery writing team of &#x201c;Ellery Queen&#x201d; ranked as number 82 in their &#x201c;Queen&#x2019;s Quorum&#x201d; of the 125 most important detective/crime fiction books published.</p><p>Anderson&#x2019;s importance as a contributor to crime fiction that featured the gentleman thief can be found in the complexity and sophistication of his plotting of the Godahl stories. The author&#x2019;s touch is often subtle and complex in the series, and Godahl&#x2019;s exploits may require several readings to appreciate fully the author&#x2019;s self-critique of literary creation, and the broader critique of American social class, wealth, and vanity that frequently parallels the depiction of Godahl&#x2019;s amazing thefts. Anderson&#x2019;s work is distinguished by its descriptive evocation of Manhattan and its surrounding environs and by its leisurely narrative pacing, but perhaps what makes his body of crime fiction most intriguing is his attraction to, and celebration of, the gentleman (and gentlewoman) thief. Two of his three published books of fiction featured criminal protagonists, and he was one of the first crime fiction writers to create a female master thief with his charismatic rogue, Sophie Lang. Occasionally, Anderson would have his series detective heroes, Oliver Armiston and Deputy Parr, pursue his two series villains, Godahl and Sophie Lang. But, unlike Conan Doyle having his Sherlock Holmes ultimately triumph over Professor Moriarty, Anderson&#x2019;s heroes never seem to defeat their more clever villains.</p><p>Nestled securely among these notorious gentleman and gentlewoman thief protagonists is the equally infamous Simon Carne, the charming villain protagonist of Guy Boothby&#x2019;s <i>A Prince of Swindlers</i> (1900), originally serialized in <i>Pearson&#x2019;s Magazine</i> in 1897. Boothby was quite adept at employing villains in his fiction, and featured several in his body of work. His most famous villain protagonist was Dr. Nikola, a nefarious genius and master of the occult who appeared in a series of novels, including <i>A Bid for Fortune: or, Dr. Nikola&#x2019;s Vendetta</i> (1895), <i>Dr. Nikola</i> (also titled <i>Dr. Nikola Returns</i>, 1896), <i>The Lust of Hate</i> (1898), <i>Dr. Nikola&#x2019;s Experiment</i> (1899), and <i>&#x201c;Farewell, Nikola&#x201d;</i> (1901). Nikola is a visually striking and aesthetically sophisticated character, and is an important model for the cultured literary gentleman thief that soon followed. Perhaps an even more fascinating Boothby villain is Pharos, the Egyptian, featured in the 1899 novel of the same title. Pharos is, in actuality, the mummy Ptahmes, possessing magical attributes that he puts to appropriately evil use in his wicked schemes. As a prototype, <i>Pharos, the Egyptian</i> anticipates the classic Universal Studios 1932 horror film <i>The Mummy</i>, directed by Karl Freund and starring the iconic Boris Karloff (resurrected in 1999 starring Brendan Fraser). Despite this impressive cabinet of entertaining creations, Simon Carne remains Boothby&#x2019;s most ingenious villain, and <i>A Prince of Swindlers</i> remains one of Boothby&#x2019;s finest books.</p><p>As biographer Paul Depasquale notes, Guy Boothby &#x201c;remains perhaps South Australia&#x2019;s most neglected successful author, except by antiquarians and book collectors.&#x201d; On October 13, 1867, in Adelaide, South Australia, Guy Newell Boothby was born to a father who served in the South Australian Legislative Assembly. After moving to England with his mother, he was educated at the Priory School in Salisbury and at Lord Weymouth&#x2019;s Grammar School in Warminster, Wiltshire (some sources also cite Christ&#x2019;s Hospital in London as another school Boothby attended). At sixteen, he returned to Australia, and with his father&#x2019;s and grandfather&#x2019;s political connections, he was hired as the private secretary to the mayor of Adelaide, Lewis Cohen, in 1890. Boothby once wrote plays, including comic operas, but although a few of these plays were produced, he failed to discover the type of success in the theater that he would eventually find as a highly prolific and popular writer of melodramatic fiction. Around 1891, Boothby traveled extensively with his friend Longley Taylor around the Pacific Islands and in the Far East.</p><p>In 1892, Boothby voyaged across the Pacific Islands region, and journeyed from Northern Queensland to Adelaide. He used these experiences in his first book, entitled <i>On the Wallaby; or, Through the East and Across Australia</i>, published in 1894. The following year, he married Rose Alice Bristowe. Also in 1895, Boothby published <i>A Lost Endeavour</i> and <i>The Marriage of Esther: A Torres Straits Sketch</i>. Besides the five Nikola adventures, Guy Boothby eventually penned more than fifty books during his brief lifetime, many of them&#x2014;including <i>The Beautiful White Devil</i> (1897), <i>Love Made Manifest</i> (1899), and <i>The Curse of the Snake</i> (1902)&#x2014;sensational potboilers intending to do nothing more than satisfy a voracious readership. Of his writing habits, an obituary published in the <i>Advertiser </i>noted:</p><p>In answer to a request made by an interviewer of the <i>London Weekly Sun</i>, some time ago, Mr. Guy Boothby explained his methods of work. They were somewhat paralyzing. He got up at a fearful hour in the early dawn, when Londoners were just going to bed. His two secretaries had to be there at 5:30 a.m. He talked his novels into a phonograph, and when he had talked enough his secretaries transcribed it direct on the typewriter. (&#x201c;Obituaries Australia&#x201d;)</p><p>Boothby&#x2019;s last book, <i>In the Power of the Sultan</i>, was published in 1908, three years after his death. His literary efforts brought him financial success (his earnings perhaps as high as twenty thousand pounds a year), which allowed him a well-to-do gentleman&#x2019;s life that involved horse breeding and book collecting. On February 26, 1905, Boothby died from influenza at the tragically young age of thirty-seven, survived by his wife, two daughters, and a son. He was buried at Bournemouth, England.</p><p>A <i>New York Times </i>obituary covering Guy Boothby&#x2019;s death printed this backhanded compliment about the author:</p><p>Books from his pen appeared wi...</p></p><h2>Baroque and Rococo Art and Architecture</h2><p><p> <i>Baroque and Rococo Art and Architecture</i> is the first in-depth history of one of the great periods of Western art, spanning the years 1585 to 1785.&nbsp; The text treats the major media&#x2013;painting, sculpture, drawings, prints, and architecture&#x2013;as well as gardens, furniture, tapestries, costume, jewelry, and ceramics, all in terms of their original function and patronage and with emphasis on the social, political and cultural context.&nbsp; Organized by country and medium, the book contains biographies of the leading creative figures of the time, from Caravaggio and Rembrandt to Watteau and Hogarth.&nbsp; Significantly, Professor Neuman offers the fullest account to date of women artists and the representation of women and families in art.&nbsp; Additionally, drawing from recent scholarship, the text explores such fields as Spanish polychrome sculpture and Viceregal American painting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Baroque and Rococo Art and Architecture</i> reviews traditional and recent strategies for interpreting artworks.&nbsp; It also traces the dissemination of visual ideas through prints and drawings&#x2013;the forerunners of today&#x2019;s art reproductions and digital media.&nbsp; In special sections the text raises questions regarding the nature of perception and how artists transfer optical data to the canvas.&nbsp; Artists&#x2019; techniques, from painting and printmaking to sculpting in marble and casting in bronze, are explained.&nbsp; Analysis of the institutions of art, such as the royal academies, apprenticeship systems, and artists&#x2019; exhibition rooms, complements an examination of collecting at all levels of society.&nbsp; The book is exceptional in considering issues related to authenticity and the relative value of artworks based on attribution.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The illustrations comprise a visual resource of unprecedented quality, with some 450 images reproduced in full color and in a large format that ensures high detail and emphasizes recent conservation efforts.&nbsp; Finally, an extensive glossary introduces seventeenth- and eighteenth-century art terms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p></p><p><p> <b>Robert Neuman</b> is Professor of Art History at Florida State University, where he specializes in early modern European art and architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp; He received his PhD from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.&nbsp; His scholarship ranges widely, encompassing all media including decorative arts, costume, and garden history.&nbsp; In addition to articles, book chapters, and review essays, he is the author of the book, <i>Robert de Cotte and the Perfection of Architecture in Eighteenth-Century France</i>.&nbsp; Several awards, including grants from the French government and the Millard Meiss Fund, have supported his research.&nbsp; Professor Neuman has been recognized for excellence in teaching with three major awards at Florida State.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p> <i>&#x201c;It is updated, far more inclusive than the available texts, and takes a fresh approach to scholarly work.&#x201d; </i> </p> <p>- <i>Victor Coonin</i>, Rhodes College</p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <i>&#x201c;A well-written and researched book, more thorough than most general textbooks, with good scholarship and good illustrations, student-friendly, and a good basis for lectures.&#x201d; </i> </p> <p>- <i>Jill E.

Instead, it stands at the center of his renewal of the practice and meaning of philosophy itself. Lemm provides an original contribution to on-going debates on the essence of humanism and its future. <br><br>At the center of this new interpretation stands Nietzsche's thesis that animal life and its potential for truth, history, and morality depends on a continuous antagonism between forgetfulness (animality) and memory (humanity). This relationship accounts for the emergence of humanity out of animality as a function of the antagonism between civilization and culture.<br><br>By taking the antagonism of culture and civilization to be fundamental for Nietzsche's conception of humanity and its becoming, Lemm gives a new entry point into the political significance of Nietzsche's thought. The opposition between civilization and culture allows for the possibility that politics is more than a set of civilizational techniques that seek to manipulate, dominate, and exclude the animality of the human animal. By seeing the deep-seated connections of politics with culture, Nietzsche orients politics beyond the domination over life and, instead, offers the animality of the human being a positive, creative role in the organization of life. Lemm's book presents Nietzsche as the thinker of an emancipatory and affirmative biopolitics.<br><br>This book will appeal not only to readers interested in Nietzsche, but also to anyone interested in the theme of the animal in philosophy, literature, cultural studies and the arts, as well as those interested in the relation between biological life and politics.</p></p><p>Vanessa Lemm is Professor of Philosophy at the School of Humanities and Languages at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. She is the author of Nietzsche&#x2019;s Animal Philosophy: Culture, Politics, and the Animality of the Human Being (New York: Fordham University Press, 2009), Nietzsche y el pensamiento politico contempor�neo (Santiago: Fondo de cultura econ�mica, 2013) and several articles on Nietz sche, biopolitics, and contemporary political theory.

Unless changed, these incentives will only worsen the problems in the coming months and years. He demonstrates how market forces have been driven out from the American healthcare system, making it nearly impossible to solve problems as effectively or efficiently as in virtually every other type of consumer marketplace. Goodman cuts through the politics to think "outside the box" and propose dozens of bold and crucial innovations that, if adopted, would enable caregivers, entrepreneurs, and patients to use their knowledge and creativity to create access to low-cost, high-quality healthcare.</p><p><p><b>John C.

If we wish to understand loss experience, we must learn details of survivors&#39; stories. In How We Grieve, Thomas Attig tells real-life tales to illustrate the poignant disruption of life and suffering that loss entails. He shows how through grieving we meet daunting challenges, make critical choices, and reshape our lives. These intimate treatments of coping hold valuable lessons that address the needs of grieving people and those who hope to support and comfort them. The accounts promote understanding of grief itself, encourage respect for individuality and the uniqueness of loss experiences, show how to deal with helplessness in the face of &#34;choiceless&#34; events, and offers much priceless guidance for caregivers. Grieving is not a process of passively living through stages. Nor is it a clinical problem to be solved or managed by others. How We Grieve shows that grieving is an active, coping process of relearning how to be and act in a world where loss transforms the fabric of our lives. Loss challenges us to relearn things and places; relationships with others, including fellow survivors, the deceased, and even God; and most of all ourselves, including our daily life patterns and the meanings of our own life stories.</p><p>In How we Grieve, Thomas Attig tells real-life tales to illustrate the poignant disruption of life and suffering that loss entails.

Bringing together art history and the social and political history of San Francisco, this vividly detailed study unravels the complex cultural encounter that occurred between the women and men living in Chinatown and the artists who walked its streets, observed its commerce, and visited its nightclubs.<br><br> Artistic representations of San Francisco's Chinatown include the work of some of the city's most gifted artists, among them the photographers Laura Adams Armer, Arnold Genthe, Dorothea Lange, Eadweard Muybridge, and Carleton Watkins and the painters Edwin Deakin, Yun Gee, Theodore Wores, and the members of the Chinese Revolutionary Artists' Club. Looking at the work of these artists and many others, Anthony Lee shows how their experiences in the district helped encourage, and even structured, some of their most ambitious experiments with brush and lens.<br><br> In addition to discussing important developments in modern art history, Lee highlights the social and political context behind these striking images. He demonstrates the value of seeing paintings and photographs as cultural documents, and in so doing, opens a fascinating new perspective on San Francisco's Chinatown.</p><p>"In his graceful integration of insights and literature from the disparate fields of art history, history, and ethnic studies, and with his focus on a little known body of visual images and image-makers, Lee has written a book that promises to make a significant contribution in terms of both subject and methodology. The residents of his Chinatown are not merely subjects of an orientalizing gaze, they are themselves producers of images, shapers of the neighborhood's distinctive physical appearance, followers of both American and Chinese political and cultural developments. . . . [This] book asserts the possibilities of images as sources of cultural meaning and reinserts art history into a central position in American cultural studies."--Martha A. Sandweiss, Professor of American Studies and History, Amherst College<p> "The author invites the reader to understand the paintings and photographs he is examining. . . as sites of human enactment where Chinese and non-Chinese alike participate in acts of cultural encounter." --Rodger C. Birt, Professor of Humanities and American Studies, San Francisco State University</p><b>Anthony W.

Founded in New York in 1922 by composer and musician Alfred Piantodosi, Alfred Publishing was purchased by Morty&#39;s father Sam Manus in 1928. A classical violinist, Sam decided to change the company&#39;s focus from pop sheet music to educational print music and added many solos for accordion and wind instruments. When Morty joined the company in 1952, he had recently received a business degree from City College of New York. Soon after, Sam retired and Morty became president. A clarinetist and pianist who received extensive musical training in his youth, Morty felt inspired by the need for quality music education products. Drawing upon his musical experience, he oversaw the development of an instructional series for accordion, followed by books for guitar and piano. Morty is the author and editor of numerous titles in Alfred&#39;s catalog, including many books in Alfred&#39;s Basic Piano Library. As the company expanded, Alfred outgrew its New York headquarters in 1975 and moved its offices to Los Angeles and its warehouse to upstate New York. Eventually, instructional materials were expanded into all areas of music, and on June 1, 2005, Alfred Music Publishing acquired Warner Bros. Publications from the Warner Music Group. Today, Alfred&#39;s roster of music editors includes such noted composers as Sally K. Albrecht, Gayle Kowalchyk, E. L. Lancaster, John O&#39;Reilly, Anna Laura Page and Andy Albritton, among many other talented editors. Alfred&#39;s catalog consists of more than 45,000 active titles, making Alfred the world&#39;s largest educational music publisher. Although Alfred now employs 290 people worldwide, it remains a family business. Morty met his wife Iris when she was working for Alfred on Saturdays. Iris has worked on a full-time basis for Alfred since the late 1960s, and maintains the position of Executive Producer. In the 1980s, two of the couple&#39;s sons, Steven and Ron, joined Alfred. Ron is currently Chief Executive Officer. With the support and vision of his family, Morty is leading Alfred into the 21st century by continuing to expand into new technologies while adapting to market changes and keeping its company-wide commitment to service and music education.</p><h2>World of Aldus Manutius: Business and Scholarship in Renaissance Venice</h2><p>Hardcover, green cloth, 1st U.S. Edition, a clean bright copy in dust jacket that has minor dust soil, light wear and is now protected in a clear Brodart cover. Contents clean and unmarked, 350pp, includes bibliography, index, b/w illustrations, notes at the end of each chapter. Publisher&#39;s statements: &#34;The relationship between Renaissance scholarship and printing is the subject of this fascinating biographical study. The book centers on the life and work of Aldus Manutius (1450-1515), printer and man of letters--his background, his business practices, and his impact on the intellectual life of the times. Martin Lowry discusses the structure of the Aldine Press, analyzes its output during the founder&#39;s lifetime, and traces changes in its policies. After examining Aldus&#39;s editorial method in the light of recently discovered press copies, he offers a radical revision of Aldus&#39;s accepted position in the development of the printed book. He maintains that Aldus, far from being the apostle of the inexpensive book for mass circulation, was responsible for giving the printed text the academic and social respectively previously enjoyed by the manuscript. Conveying the essential importance of Manutius by bringing out the conflicts between commerce and learning, this book makes a solid contribution to intellectual history, the history of printing and the book, and the social and economic history of Venice in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. &#34;</p><p></p><h2>Places of Encounter, Volume 1: Time, Place, and Connectivity in World History, Volume One: To 1600</h2><p><p><em>Places of Encounter</em> provides a place-based approach to world history, focusing on specific locations at critical moments when human history was transformed as a result of encounters-physical, political, cultural, intellectual, and religious. Original, contributed essays by leading academics in the field explore places from Hadar to Xi'an, Salvador to New York, and numerous other locations that have produced historical shockwaves and significant global impact throughout history.

This is among the fundamental questions about the nature and politics of time that philosophers, artists and more recently curators have investigated over the past two decades. If clock time&#x2015;a linear measurement that can be unified, followed and owned&#x2015;is largely the invention of capitalist modernity and binds us to its strictures, how can we extricate ourselves and discover alternative possibilities of experiencing time? </p><p>Recent art has explored such diverse registers of temporality as wasting and waiting, regression and repetition, d�j� vu and seriality, unrealized possibility and idleness, non-consummation and counter-productivity, the belated and the premature, the disjointed and the out-of-sync&#x2015;all of which go against sequentialist time and index slips in chronological experience. While such theorists as Giorgio Agamben and Georges Didi-Huberman have proposed &#x201c;anachronistic&#x201d; or &#x201c;heterochronic&#x201d; readings of history, artists have opened up the field of time to the extent that the very notion of the contemporary is brought into question.

In the introduction, the authors, native Transylvanians, provide a background sketch of the area and insight into the psyche of its people, but the book's intent is clearly to entertain. The 16 stories, each of which is illustrated with a full-or half-page pen-and-ink drawing, are divided into 3 sections. Part one covers the more common types of ghouls-ghosts, vampires, and werewolves. "Haunted Treasures" highlights a popular theme and provides a historical foundation. For centuries, gold mines dotted the Transylvanian mountains, so naturally a number of legends sprang up concerning lost fortunes-many with ghostly guardians. "Eerie Fairy Tales" are traditional, European-style tales with a few macabre twists. Despite the grisly action, most of the selections have positive endings. Justice is served, evildoers are punished, and only rarely do the innocent suffer permanent damage. An appendix explains each story's origin and defines unfamiliar terminology. Fright fans, along with storytellers and folktale devotees, will delight in this collection.<br><i>Mary Jo Drungil, Niles Public Library District, IL</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6-10. A handsome stranger courts a beautiful maiden by day and turns into a rotten corpse at night. A severed hand is sent special delivery to an abandoned castle. A young man watches in horror as his arms become covered in dark gray fur, and, with a long howl, he joins a pack of werewolves in the wilderness. Scary, sometimes gruesome, with dark humor and dramatic immediacy, these stories are great for storytelling and reading aloud. The authors are immigrants to the U.S., now teaching comparative literature at the University of Georgia. They heard versions of these stories while growing up in the Transylvanian Alps and retell them here in the simple, direct style of the oral tradition. There's a fascinating general introduction, and brief notes at the back discuss each story, including where the authors heard it, who told it to them, and how it fits with general folklore motifs and with the religious and political history of the region. Laszlo Kubinyi's shadowy pen-and-ink drawings with close cross-hatching capture the mystery of demons and transformation in the moonlight. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Biology of Ticks Volume 2</h2><p>Biology of Ticks is the most comprehensive work on tick biology and tick-borne diseases. This second edition is a multi-authored work, featuring the research and analyses of renowned experts across the globe. Spanning two volumes, the book examines the systematics, biology, structure, ecological adaptations, evolution, genomics and the molecular processes that underpin the growth, development and survival of these important disease-transmitting parasites. Also discussed is the remarkable array of diseases transmitted (or caused) by ticks, as well as modern methods for their control. This book should serve as a modern reference for students, scientists, physicians, veterinarians and other specialists.<br><br>Volume I covers the biology of the tick and features chapters on tick systematics, tick life cycles, external and internal anatomy, and others dedicated to specific organ systems, specifically, the tick integument, mouthparts and digestive system, salivary glands, waste removal, salivary glands, respiratory system, circulatory system and hemolymph, fat body, the nervous and sensory systems and reproductive systems.<br><br>Volume II includes chapters on the ecology of non-nidicolous and nidicolous ticks, genetics and genomics (including the genome of the Lyme disease vector Ixodes scapularis) and immunity, including host immune responses to tick feeding and tick-host interactions, as well as the tick's innate immune system that prevents and/or controls microbial infections. Six chapters cover in depth the many diseases caused by the major tick-borne pathogens, including tick-borne protozoa, viruses, rickettsiae of all types, other types of bacteria (e.g., the Lyme disease agent) and diseases related to tick paralytic agents and toxins. The remaining chapters are devoted to tick control using vaccines, acaricides, repellents, biocontrol, and, finally, techniques for breeding ticks in order to develop tick colonies for scientific study.<br></p><p><br>Dr. Daniel E.

Michele Foster talks to those who were the first to teach in desegregated southern schools and to others who taught in large urban districts, such as Boston, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. All go on record about the losses and gains accompanying desegregation, the inspirations and rewards of teaching, and the challenges and solutions they see in the coming years.</p><p>Michele Foster is Sherman Family Endowed Chair in Urban Education Research and the executive director of the Urban Education Research Center at the University of Missouri&#x2013;Kansas City. A frequent contributor to journals and books on education, she is the author of <em>Black Teachers on Teaching</em> (The New Press); the editor of <em>Readings on Equal Education</em>, vol. 11: <em>Qualitative Investigations into Schools and Schooling</em>; and a co-editor of <em>Unrelated Kin: Ethnic and Gender Identity in Women&#x2019;s Personal Narratives</em> and <em>Growing Up African American in Catholic School</em>.<br>How has the teaching profession been experienced and understood by black teachers? To answer her question, Foster (Unrelated Kin) conducted 20 "life history" interviews with black teachers between 1988 and 1996. Of interest not only to black teachers, parents and school administrators, Black Teachers on Teaching gives all readers frank firsthand reactions to school integration and its results for teachers and students, as well as an overview of blacks in education over much of this past century. For many of these teachers, integration has been a failure, not only depriving black children of the dedicated instruction of black teachers but also resulting in the firing or displacement of black staff. One interviewee recounts being sent to an east Texas school to fulfill legal requirements of integration, only to spend six months in an office, having been refused a teaching assignment because of the prejudice of white colleagues and protesting parents. Meanwhile, white teachers maintained their right to teach in the newly integrated schools. Over the years, many of these black teachers noted that bright black students were scorned or ignored by their white teachers and socially discriminated against by their white classmates. Many blacks of average ability equal to that of their white counterparts were relegated to special education or remedial classes. There are a couple of interviews that are superficial and could have been excluded, but for the most part Foster provides frontline reports on subjects that many people know only from a distance. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Creative Artist&#39;s Legal Guide: Copyright, Trademark and Contracts in Film and Digital Media Production</h2><p><p><b>The essential guide to intellectual property law for all media producers&#x2014;students and teachers, amateurs and professionals</b><br><br> In today's complex media environment, aspiring filmmakers and new media artists are as vulnerable as swimmers in shark-infested waters.

This volume of shorter pieces reflects Regan&#39;s thinking over the past decade. Besides chapters on the meaning and repercussions of animal rights and animal liberation, two chapters address being an employee of an organization that experiments or uses animals (Regan&#39;s employer, he says, yearly kills thousands of animals). Two other chapters compare animal rights to, on the one hand, the causes for gay and lesbian rights, and on the other, the rights of African/American slaves. Regan&#39;s central thesis can be summed up as anti-utilitarian and Kantian, and is opposed to those (like Singer) wanting animal liberation without necessarily advocating rights. Regan argues that because non-human animals are similar to humans (both, for example, believe, remember, intend, and experience fear, anger, and loneliness), the two groups have a &#34;basic moral right to respectful treatment.&#34; Annotation c.

In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.<br> <br> Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.</p><p>John Holland's <i>Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems</i> is one of the classics in the field of complex adaptive systems. Holland is known as the father of genetic algorithms and classifier systems and in this tome he describes the theory behind these algorithms. Drawing on ideas from the fields of biology and economics, he shows how computer programs can evolve.

Although this is certainly sensible advice, the future is unpredictable, and uncertainty can never be eliminated from the decision-making process. The key is to be positive about uncertainty, that is approaching every decision with an open mind to create more future possibilities, even while assuming that change is inevitable. Creative Decision Making helps you do just that by presenting four paradoxical principles designed to expand the way you think about the decisions you make. The revised edition includes discussion on using positive uncertainty to manage information overload and what you can do to decide creatively in today&#39;s more rapidly changing world.</p><p></p><h2>Simulations of Machines Using MATLAB and SIMULINK (Bookware Companion Series (Pacific Grove, Calif.).)</h2><p>This book is intended as a supplement for undergraduate courses in Kinematics or Dynamics of Mechanisms, taught in Mechanical Engineering departments.

In<i> Proust among the Nations</i>, she takes the development of her thought on this crisis a stage further, revealing it as a distinctly Western problem.</p>In a radical rereading of the Dreyfus affair through the lens of Marcel Proust in dialogue with Freud, Rose offers a fresh and nuanced account of the rise of Jewish nationalism and the subsequent creation of Israel. Following Proust&#x2019;s heirs, Beckett and Genet, and a host of Middle Eastern writers, artists, and filmmakers, Rose traces the shifting dynamic of memory and identity across the crucial and ongoing cultural links between Europe and Palestine.&nbsp;A powerful and elegant analysis of the responsibility of writing, <i>Proust among the Nations</i> makes the case for literature as a unique resource for understanding political struggle and gives us new ways to think creatively about the violence in the Middle East.</p><p><p>&nbsp;<b>Jacqueline Rose</b> is professor English at Queen Mary, University of London. She is the author of many books, including <i>The Last Resistance</i>, <i>The Question of Zion</i>, and <i>Albertine: A Novel</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Jacqueline Rose&#x2019;s brilliant achievement in her new book is to argue knowledgeably and persuasively for the relevance that reading Proust and Freud has to the violent antagonism opposing Jews and Arabs in the Middle East. This is a compelling work that will provoke much debate.&#x201d;</p> (Leo Bersani, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Rose has an exceptional gift for writing about a moment in the past in such a way as to light up an entire landscape of human experience&#x2014;always with an eye to our own times and predicaments. In a sense, the Dreyfus trial is her Madeleine episode. As she brings it to mind, a whole host of thoughts and emotions are stirred&#x2014;including ones we would rather resist, not least on the subject of Israel-Palestine. Proust, Rose argues, wants us &#x2018;to worry to the very edge of our convictions.&#x2019; Her book, written with style, insight, erudition, feeling, and flair, gets us to do exactly that.&#x201d;</p> (Brian Klug, University of Oxford)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This book pushes at the limits of postcolonialism and deconstructs some of its certainties&#x2014;to wit, the smugness that smoothes out complexity in order to make it easier to separate victim from oppressor. Rose shows not only that those in the West are the creators of their own version of the Orient, but that the Orient is embedded, however uncomfortably, in the West, and that there are trading pathways that crisscross between Europe and the Middle East, which must at all cost be remembered and maintained. It is exhilarating to read something so bold, that is reaching so urgently for something beyond itself, so strongly anchored, and yet in search of truths somewhere most people refuse to look.&#x201d;</p> (Ingrid Wassenaar, author of Proustian Passions <i>Ingrid Wassenaar, author of "Proustian Passions"</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Deliberately audacious, the work examines the philosophical and mental resources in Proust and links them to issues as surprising as they are difficult, such as the massacre of Sabra and Chatila in Lebanon in 1982.&#x201d; (<i>Proust et les ideologies sociales</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Rose makes a provocative connection between Dreyfus and Jewish nationalism, but she is also careful to point out that she does not make this move in a justificatory or redemptive way. She is at all times aware of the power of fantasy to overtake truth. . . . She places Proust and Freud in dialogue here with Samuel Beckett and Jean Genet, not in an isolated textual vacuum but as intellectual activists grappling with ambivalence. . . . The scholarship that underpins [this book] shows how close reading can be used rigorously both to retrieve from the archive, and to support a broader argument. . . .

Such self-dramatizing characters appear in the work of other playwrights of the era as well, Marlowe&#x2019;s Edward II and Tamburlaine among them. But Elizabethan playwrights were not alone in realizing that a sense of theater was essential to the exercise of power. Real rulers knew it, too, and none better than Queen Elizabeth. In this fascinating study of political stagecraft in the Elizabethan era, Garry Wills explores a period of vast cultural and political change during which the power of make-believe to make power real was not just a theory but an essential truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wills examines English culture as Catholic Christianity&#x2019;s rituals were being overturned and a Protestant queen took the throne. New iconographies of power were necessary for the new Renaissance liturgy to displace the medieval church-state. The author illuminates the extensive imaginative constructions that went into Elizabeth&#x2019;s reign and the explosion of great Tudor and Stuart drama that provided the imaginative power to support her long and successful rule.</p><p><b>Garry Wills</b> is Emeritus Professor of History at Northwestern University.

As a product of the 1960s, Viennese Actionism and its extremism represent an artistic phenomenon of great contemporary interest, when we find that violence resides everywhere behind the false appearance of universal peace. Arising in a marginal cultural environment, this book looks at Viennese Actionism art as a convulsive, virulent re-encounter between experimental art and destruction.</p><p></p><h2>Ethnic Conflict: Causes, Consequences, and Responses</h2><p>Why does ethnic conflict remain one of the major security challenges in today&#x2019;s world? Can we avoid another Rwanda in the future? How was it possible, after almost four decades, to achieve a lasting settlement for the conflict in Northern Ireland, while the conflict in Kashmir remains unresolved after more than sixty years? <p>These and other questions are the focus of this book. Investigating the causes and consequences of ethnic conflict, the authors argue that the most effective responses are those that take into account factors at the local, state, regional and global level and which avoid seeking simplistic explanations and solutions to what is a truly complex phenomenon. What matters most for understanding ethnic conflicts are the choices that people make&#x2015;leaders and followers alike&#x2015;and not a set of mysterious unknowable forces.</p> <p>Once we know that ethnic conflicts are not difficult to understand, but that there is a lot to understand about them, we can also appreciate that they are not impossible to resolve. However, it takes skilful, committed and principled leaders to achieve just solutions that are supported by their followers, and it takes the long-term commitment of the international community to enable and sustain these solutions.</p></p><p>Karl Cordell is Reader in Politics at the University of Plymouth <p> Stefan Wolff is Professor of Political Science and Director of the Centre for International Crisis Management and Conflict Resolution at the University of Nottingham</p>"A welcome blend of readability, originality, and utilisation of informed writing on ethnic conflict in its comparative and international settings."<br> <i><b>New Zealand International Review</b></i><br> <br> <p> </p> <p>"This volume reflects the cutting edge of scholarship on ethnic conflict by two leading scholars in the field.

This powerful book is essential to making sense of the new and ongoing steps towards normalization between the longtime antagonists. Challenging the conventional wisdom of perpetual hostility between the United States and Cuba--beyond invasions, covert operations, assassination plots using poison pens and exploding seashells, and a grinding economic embargo--<em>Back Channel to Cuba</em> chronicles a surprising, untold history of bilateral efforts toward rapprochement and reconciliation. Since 1959, conflict and aggression have dominated the story of the United States and Cuba. Now, William M. LeoGrande and Peter Kornbluh present a remarkably new and relevant account. From John F. Kennedy's offering of an olive branch to Fidel Castro after the missile crisis, to Henry Kissinger's top secret quest for normalization, to Barack Obama's promise of a new approach, LeoGrande and Kornbluh reveal a fifty-year record of dialogue and negotiations, both open and furtive, indicating a path toward a world beyond the legacy of hostility. <br><br>LeoGrande and Kornbluh have uncovered hundreds of formerly secret U.S. documents and conducted interviews with dozens of negotiators, intermediaries, and policy makers, including Fidel Castro and Jimmy Carter. The authors describe how, despite the intense political clamor surrounding efforts to improve relations with Havana, serious negotiations have been conducted by every presidential administration since Eisenhower's through secret, back-channel diplomacy. Including ten critical lessons for U.S. negotiators, the book offers a key perspective on the normalization process underway and illuminates a fascinating passage in U.S.-Cuban relations as it happens.<br><br></p><p>&#34;LeoGrande and Kornbluh have analyzed thoroughly the history of dialogue between two countries locked in a contradictory relationship for five decades, with each side skeptical that the other truly wanted improved relations. With continual change in Washington, and continuity in Cuban leadership, the authors draw important lessons from the efforts of every administration since Eisenhower to negotiate with Cuba.&#34;--President Jimmy CarterWilliam M. LeoGrande, professor of government at American University, is the author of <i>Our Own Backyard: The United States in Central America, 1977-1992</i>, among other books. <br><br>Peter Kornbluh, director of the Cuba Documentation Project at the National Security Archive in Washington, D.C., is the author of <i>The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability</i>, among other books.</p><h2>Evergreen: A Guide to Writing with Readings</h2><p>With carefully crafted instruction, engaging student models, and plentiful practice exercises, this best-selling text continues to provide the most effective paragraph-essay level writing instruction available.

It shows how such&nbsp;occurences fitted in quite naturally with the "common sense" of the time and offers&nbsp;explanations of these riveting and ultimately rational phenomena.</p> <p>What made reasonable, educated men and women behave in ways that seem utterly nonsensical to us today? This question and many more are answered in the fascinating book.</p></p><p>Darren Oldridge is a lecturer in history at University College Worcester. He is the editor of <em>The WItchcraft Reader</em>.Despite the spooky title and cover art, this is not a collection of Gothic ghost stories or fireside tales. These accounts of pre-modern beliefs (spanning the late Middle Ages to the late 17th century) employ serious scholarship. Oldridge contends that examining the so-called "strange" beliefs of the past can help us achieve a richer understanding of history. "If we can begin to understand why a French judge warned people about demonically possessed apples in 1602," he writes, "we might start to unravel the intellectual context in which he lived." But more importantly, Oldridge hopes that grasping the context of these beliefs will encourage readers to take a critical look at their own preconceived ideas. If the book suffers from anything, it is an intellectual earnestness and over-seriousness most evident in Oldridge&#x2019;s constant insistence that the majority of the people he writes about were acting with "good intentions." For example, in a chapter on the rationale behind the execution of heretics in Medieval times, Oldridge notes that "the pious desire to retrieve souls from damnation could, of course, conceal more worldly motives for suppressing dissent, but it would be unduly cynical to assume this was normally the case." In moments like this, it seems that Oldridge&#x2019;s single-minded adherence to his thesis&#x2014;that "bizarre" past behavior and beliefs are entirely rational when taken in context&#x2014;blinds him to the instances when people may very well have had impure motivations. That said, this is still a fascinating historical study that encourages self-reflection. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The introduction provides a very useful overview of stylistics as a whole and discusses the links between linguistics and literary criticism. Detailed analysis of each genre follows, with exercises designed to develop ideas further. There is also extended discussion of the exercises and suggestions for further readings for those interested in carrying out their own stylistic analyses. A particularly useful feature of the book is the series of checksheets of style features to look for when analysing texts, which occur at the ends of chapters.

The society and culture of ancient Rome is illuminated by the character of the Roman citizen in various guises as soldier, land-owner, employer, father, priest, banqueter and elector. The book considers the divisions between the different groups in Roman society, revealing a highly divided society with legal status dependent upon wealth and honour. The freedom of the Roman citizen is contrasted with the inferiority of the slave, an inferiority which was physically and also psychologically vital to Roman society. The author also investigates Roman notions of space and time and shows that every sphere of life, be it the family, the army, politics or farm work, was imbued with religion. There was a time and place for everything, every activity having an attendant god to whom Romans would appeal for advice, backing or consent. Roman ideas about their own bodies, hygiene, clothing, food and sexuality are also considered, and, as throughout the whole book, Florence Dupont draws on a broad selection of vivid contemporary accounts to illustrate her argument.</p><p>This is a vivid and intimate account of everyday life in ancient Rome during the Republic, from the downfall of the kings in 509 BC to the seizure of power by Augustus in 27 BC. Drawing widely on rich contemporary sources, Florence Dupont recreates the public and private lives, rituals, actions, institutions, and religion of the Roman Republic. She shows how Roman culture and society revolved around one kind of individual, the Roman citizen, whose roles encompassed soldier, voter, estate-owner, householder and slave-master, <i>paterfamilias,</i> priest, party-goer, farmer and city-dweller. It was citizenship, she reveals, that shaped Roman notions of space, time, human nature and the human body. <p>The author describes the profound effect of Rome's increasing power and wealth. Excess, luxury and greed gradually eroded the traditional values of order, thrift, honor and liberty: citizens became transformed into subjects. 'Streets flowed with precious wines and the blood of exotic wild animals and inumerable oxen,' she writes. 'Makeshift theaters were thrown up and bedecked with gold and ivory. In a hopeless attempt to empty both its own coffers and those of the nobility, the republic endowed the city with temples, basilicas and colonnades. But the world was too rich, too vast, and Rome, at its center, choked on all its wealth.'</p><b>Florence Dupont</b> is Professor of Latin at the University of Nice. <p> <b>Christopher Woodall</b> is a freelance translator and journalist.</p></p><h2>The Death of the Big Men and the Rise of the Big Shots: Custom and Conflict in East New Britain (ASAO Studies in Pacific Anthropology, 3)</h2><p><p> In 1994, the Pacific island village of Matupit was partially destroyed by a volcanic eruption. This study focuses on the subsequent reconstruction and contests over the morality of exchanges that are generative of new forms of social stratification. Such new dynamics of stratification are central to contemporary processes of globalization in the Pacific, and more widely. Through detailed ethnography of the transactions that a displaced people entered into in seeking to rebuild their lives, this book analyses how people re-make sociality in an era of post-colonial neoliberalism without taking either the transformative power of globalization or the resilience of indigenous culture as its starting point. It also contributes to the understanding of the problems of post-disaster reconstruction and development projects.</p></p><p><p> <strong>Keir Martin</strong> is Associate Professor in Social Anthropology at the University of Oslo and is the author of a number of academic and media publications on Papua New Guinea and the global economy.

This does not mean that the arguments or ethnographic cases of the book are simple. On the contrary, Martin&#x2019;s nuanced study of language and exchanges grounded in the solid ethnographic study of the social reality of the inhabitants of Matupit and Sikut shed light on very complex issues... Martin&#x2019;s work is an exemplary case of how to study complex and long term political-economic trends as they unfold in concrete social settings often in less than obvious ways.

Of the overall significance of this compelling ethnography, one might recall that once there was talk of a new Melanesian ethnography (Josephides 1991) and then of a new Melanesian history (Foster 1995).

The son of a working cowboy and ranch foreman, Elmer was expected to follow in father's footsteps but learned at an early age that he had&nbsp;no talents in the cowboy's trade. Buck Kelton called Elmer "Pop," said he was "slow as the seven-year itch,"&nbsp;and reluctantly supported his son's decision to become a student at the University of Texas, and, eventually, a journalist and&nbsp;writer.&nbsp;Kelton's life in ranch and oil patch Texas during the Great Depression is told with warm nostalgic humor animated with stories of the cowboys and their wives and kids who gave the time and place its special flavor. He writes with great feeling of his service in WW2 in France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, and the romantic circumstances in which his life changed in the village of Ebensee, Austria.</p><p><p>Praise for author Elmer Kelton:</p><p>"Elmer Kelton does not write Westerns.

The writings in Out of Order, Out of Sight trace the development of her thinking about her artwork and the art world, and her evolving awareness of herself as a creative, racial, and gendered subject situated in an often limiting and always absurd cultural and social context.</p></p><p>Professor of Philosophy at Wellesley College, Adrian Piper is a theorist/critic and a distinguished analytic philosopher whose research publications are in metaethics and Kant&#39;s metaphysics. She exhibits her work at the John Weber and Paula Cooper Galleries in New York.Words and language are integral to conceptual art, and conceptual artist/academic philosopher Piper can articulate this relation from a unique position and better than most. The artist has divided her writings into two types presented in their own chronologically arranged volumes. Meta-Art exists somewhere between art and art criticism and analyzes Piper's own works; Selected Writings examines the issues surrounding these works. The style is occasionally passionate and decidedly autobiographical, as a key ingredient of Piper's art is the merger of the personal and the political. An African American activist-artist who started out in the late 1960s as Sol LeWitt's assistant, Piper creates altered photographs, performances, and installations that deal with racism and social change. This collection is important not only for elucidating the artist's own work but also for chronicling the art world of the past 25 years and for Piper's influence on others.

Indeed, Georg Lukacs&#x2014;one of the most trenchant opponents of Benjamin&#x2019;s aesthetics&#x2014;singled out this work as one of the main sources of literary modernism in the twentieth century.<br><br><i>The Origin of German Tragic Drama</i> begins with a general theoretical introduction on the nature of the baroque art of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, concentrating on the peculiar stage-form of the royal martyr dramas called <i>Trauerspiel</i>. Benjamin also comments on the engravings of Durer, and the theatre of Shakespeare and Calderon. Baroque tragedy, he argues, was distinguished from classical tragedy by its shift from myth into history.<br><br>The characteristic atmosphere of the <i>Trauerspiel</i> was consequently &#x2018;melancholy&#x2019;. The emblems of baroque allegory point to the extinct values of a classical world that they can never attain or repeat. Their suggestive power, however, remains to haunt subsequent cultures, down to this century.</p><p><b>Walter Benjamin</b> was a German-Jewish Marxist literary critic, essayist, translator, and philosopher.

This geo-political manifesto revisits the idea of Latinity, charting the history of the concept from its emergence in Europe under France&#39;s leadership, through its appropriation by the Creole elite of South America and the Spanish Caribbean in the second half of the nineteenth century, up to the present day. Reinstating the indigenous peoples, the enormous population of African descent and the 40 million Latino/as in the US that are rendered invisible by the image of a homogenous Latin America, the author asks what is at stake in the survival of an idea which subdivides the Americas. He explains why an &#34;American Union&#34; similar to the European Union is at this point unthinkable and he insists on the pressing need to leave behind an idea of Latinity which belongs to the nation-building mentality of nineteenth-century Europe.<b>Walter D.

In this book, Stephen Turner presents the first analysis and critique of the idea of practice as it has developed in the various theoretical traditions of the social sciences and the humanities.Understood broadly as a tacit understanding "shared" by a group, the concept of a practice has a fatal difficulty, Turner argues: there is no plausible mechanism by which a "practice" is transmitted or reproduced. The historical uses of the concept, from Durkheim to Kripke's version of Wittgenstein, provide examples of the contortions that thinkers have been forced into by this problem, and show the ultimate implausibility of the idea.Turner's conclusion sketches a picture of what happens when we do without the notion of a shared practice, and how this bears on social theory and philosophy.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely.

Today our ties to Israel are close&#x2015;so close that when there are differences, they tend to make the news. But it was not always this way.<br> Dennis Ross has been a direct participant in shaping U.S. policy toward the Middle East, and Israel specifically, for nearly thirty years. He served in senior roles, including as Bill Clinton's envoy for Arab-Israeli peace, and was an active player in the debates over how Israel fit into the region and what should guide our policies. In <i>Doomed to Succeed</i>, he takes us through every administration from Truman to Obama, throwing into dramatic relief each president's attitudes toward Israel and the region, the often tumultuous debates between key advisers, and the events that drove the policies and at times led to a shift in approach.<br> Ross points out how rarely lessons were learned and how distancing the United States from Israel in the Eisenhower, Nixon, Bush, and Obama administrations never yielded any benefits and why that lesson has never been learned. <i>Doomed to Succeed</i> offers compelling advice for how to understand the priorities of Arab leaders and how future administrations might best shape U.S. policy in that light.</p></p><p><b>Dennis Ross,</b> Middle East envoy for George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.<i> Foreign Affairs </i>called his first book, <i>The Missing Peace</i>, &#x201c;a major contribution to the diplomatic history of the twentieth century.&#x201d; His other books include <i>Statecraft</i> and <i>Doomed to Succeed</i>.<p>&#x201c;Dennis Ross and &#x2018;Middle East Peace Process&#x2019; are nearly synonymous . . . In <i>Doomed to Succeed</i>, the Washington hand brings his account up to date by covering the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations and looking at U.S.-Israel relations from Truman on . . . Mr. Ross&#x2019;s treatment of each administration is necessarily brief but useful for that very reason: It&#x2019;s hard to think of a college course on this subject that would not assign this book as a text.&#x201d; &#x2015;Elliot Abrams, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this well researched history Ross meticulously chronicles the bumpy ride that the two nations have taken together . . .

He comes neither to bury nor praise the administrations in which he has worked or those in which he did not; as a consequence, readers will benefit from a front-row vantage point without encountering a myopic perspective. Ross provides a learned, wise template for understanding the long-term relationship between two countries tethered to one another out of shared self-interest and geopolitical necessity and yet with sometimes-conflicting senses of the way forward.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Ross deftly explores the contingencies of this history, which hinged on personality clashes, the chaos of events, and the personal attitudes held by presidents, while stressing broader themes . . . .

In his new book he provides both a remarkable history and an insider's explanation of what has driven our policy towards Israel and the region. In the process, he tells a fascinating story not only about how the relationship evolved over time, but also about the assumptions that continue to shape our views of the region and the lessons we need to draw from this.

Baker, III, 61st U.S. Secretary of State</p><p>&#x201c;Dennis Ross brings a unique mix of experience and skill to the task of telling the story of America's relationship and encounters with Israel over the last six decades. He is an unparalleled combination of careful scholar and practitioner. Ross has been at the center of United States policy in the Middle East for three decades. No U.S. diplomat has known the key policymakers in the Middle East for as long as or as well as Ross. All this is reflected in this fascinating history. It compellingly chronicles the personalities, policy debates and seemingly unending crises the U.S. has confronted in the Middle East from the time of Israel's founding and the presidency of Harry Truman through today. <i>Doomed to Succeed</i> is destined to be an important work for a long time to come.&#x201d; &#x2015;Tom Donilon, former National Security Advisor to President Barack Obama</p><p>&#x201c;This remarkable book is a definitive treatment of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.

A must-read book for future policy-makers.&#x201d; &#x2015;Stephen Hadley, former National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush</p><p>&#x201c;For almost forty years, Dennis Ross has been an inside player and close observer of Israeli-U.S. relations. In this smart and provocative book, he provides an insightful look at the policies toward Israel pursued from the Truman Administration to the present and how that has affected America's relationships in the Middle East. It's not only great history but a guide for the future.&#x201d; &#x2015;Walter Isaacson, President and CEO of the Aspen Institute</p><p>&#x201c;Dennis Ross has written what might be the definitive book on one of the most complicated, emotionally fraught and strategically consequential relationships between two states in the world today. No one is better positioned than Ross to explore the contours of the U.S.-Israel relationship, and he does so lucidly, with nuance, analytical sophistication, a cool eye, and great authority. <i>Doomed to Succeed</i> will be mandatory reading for anyone concerned about the future of Israel, and about America's role in the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jeffrey Goldberg, author of Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror</p></p><h2>O&#39;Connor&#39;s California Practice * Civil Pretrial 2017</h2><p>For decades, California attorneys have been buying the same old pretrial procedure manuals thinking that's all they ever need for their civil practice.

These years from 1912 to 1949 were marked by civil war, revolution and invasion; but also by change and growth in the economic, social, intellectual and cultural spheres. The chapters examine economic trends in the period and the rise of the new middle class. Intellectual trends are surveyed to show the changes in traditional Chinese values and the foreign influences which played a major role in Republican China. Although it is written by specialists, the goals and approach of this Cambridge history are to explain and discuss republican China for an audience which will include scholars, students and general readers who do not have special knowledge of Chinese history.

Public interest in international investment arbitration is growing and some developed and developing countries are beginning to revisit their investment treaty policies. <em>The</em> <em>Political Economy of the Investment Treaty Regime</em> synthesises and advances the growing literature on this subject by integrating legal, economic, and political perspectives. Based on an analysis of the substantive and procedural rights conferred by investment treaties, it asks four basic questions. What are the costs and benefits of investment treaties for investors, states, and other stakeholders? Why did developed and developing countries sign the treaties? Why should private arbitrators be allowed to review public regulations passed by states? And what is the relationship between the investment treaty regime and the broader regime complex that governs international investment? <br><br>Through a concise, but comprehensive, analysis, this book fills in some of the many "blind spots" of academics from different disciplines, and is the first port of call for lawyers, investors, policy-makers, and stakeholders trying to make sense of these critical instruments governing investor-state relations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Bonnitcha</strong> joined UNSW Law as a Lecturer in July 2016.

The folks at Oxford offer an inspired answer: a classroom full of young creative talent. In this fresh, imaginative alphabet book, 26 newly discovered poems by Hughes are teamed with 3-D works by first-, second- and third-graders at the Harlem School of the Arts. The result is a marvelous union of graphics and text, alight with color and whimsy. Hughes's poems are models of brevity and wit ("There was a camel/ Who had two humps./ He thought in his youth/ They were wisdom bumps./ Then he learned/ They were nothing but humps-/ And ever since he's/ Been in the dumps"). Called forth from these words, the students' menagerie-created from clay, paper, paint and cardboard, and unfettered by artistic preconceptions-are laugh-out-loud wonderful, from the solemn, pop-eyed flock of owls to the bright explosion of fish that graces the front cover.

Environmental historian Steven Stoll identifies 1945 as the year in which environmentalism was born -- a fusion of decades-old thinking about conservation with activism to form a diverse political movement. In this thematically organized collection of primary sources, Stoll traces the development of the environmental movement and identifies its central premises and ideologies, including preservation politics, population growth, biological interdependence, climate change, ethical consumption, and environmental justice. Stoll&#39;s insightful introduction provides students with a solid overview of environmentalism&#39;s origins and contextualizes the issues raised by the documents. Document headnotes, a chronology, questions for consideration, and a selected bibliography offer additional pedagogical support.</p><p><b>STEVEN STOLL</b> is associate professor of history and American studies at Yale University.

For those of us who garden in less benign climates, the authors give instructions on mulching and wrapping such plants to protect them from freezes. It involves straw and burlap and leaves the plants looking like mummified little soldiers, but able to withstand temperatures 20 degrees lower than without protection. </p><p> The gardens pictured in the plentiful color photographs are certainly tempting, as they overflow with huge leaves, flashy foliage, exotic flowers, ponds and vines, all combined into the rich tapestry of a jungle. You can almost smell the jasmine and hear the chattering of the parrots. Thankfully, the chapter on hardy plants for the tropical look (bamboos, grasses, hardy bananas, ferns, Petasites) puts this style of garden within the reach of most gardeners, no matter if they live in Minnesota or California. Especially useful are the appendices, which list plants for a variety of design situations and a source list for the plants recommended throughout the book. <i>--Val Easton</i></p>If you love the lush, exotic look of tropical gardens, but don&#39;t live in a tropical climate, this indispensable reference comes to the rescue, revealing secrets every gardener needs to know to easily create a lush, flamboyant landscape. The author details over 500 tropical and subtropical plants that will survive and thrive in cooler climates, either in the garden or in containers that can be moved indoors before first frost.</p><h2>Essentials of Corporate Finance</h2><p>Essentials of Corporate Finance, 6/e by Ross, Westerfield, and Jordan is written to convey the most important concepts and principles of corporate finance at a level that is approachable for a wide audience. The authors retain their modern approach to finance, but have distilled the subject down to the essential topics in 18 chapters. They believe that understanding the &#x201c;why&#x201d; is just as important, if not more so, than understanding the &#x201c;how,&#x201d; especially in an introductory course. Three basic themes emerge as their central focus:<br> 1. An emphasis on intuition&#x2014;separate and explain the principles at work on a common sense, intuitive level before launching into specifics. Underlying ideas are discussed first in general terms, then followed by specific examples that illustrate in more concrete terms how a financial manager might proceed in a given situation.<br> 2. A unified valuation approach&#x2014;Net Present Value is treated as the basic concept underlying corporate finance. Every subject the authors cover is firmly rooted in valuation, and care is taken to explain how decisions have valuation effects.<br> 3. A managerial focus&#x2014;Students learn that financial management concerns management. The role of financial manager as decision maker is emphasized and they stress the need for managerial input and judgment.</p><p>Stephen Ross is presently the Franco Modigliani Professor of Finance and Economics at the Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One of the most widely published authors in finance and economics, Professor Ross is recognized for his work in developing the Arbitrage Pricing Theory and his substantial contributions to the discipline through his research in signaling, agency theory, option pricing, and the theory of the term structure of interest rates, among other topics.

Interdisciplinary in perspective and topically organized, it features balanced coverage of theory, research, and practical application, as well as a strong emphasis on the interrelationships between various developmental domains and the importance of the &#x201c;whole&#x201d; infant. <b></b> Prenatal Development. The Birth Process and The Newborn. Physical Growth. Health, Safety, and Nutrition. Motor Development. Perceptual Development. Cognitive Development. Language Development. Personality. Social Development. Emotional Development. Infant Caregiving and Education. <b></b> For anyone involved in infant care. </p></p><p>A complete overview of growth and development during the first three years of life.<p> This book presents a comprehensive overview of growth and development during the first three years of life. It is designed primarily as an introductory text for courses in infant development, infant care, and early intervention. The increasing popularity of courses on infant development in institutions of higher education throughout the United States is a reflection of the interest and attention currently devoted to infant development by the academic community and the general public. The development and expansion of early-intervention programs and child-care programs throughout the United States have increased the demand for a cadre of professionals who are knowledgeable about infant development. Anyone interested in learning about infants should find the third edition of <i>Infant Development</i> informative and helpful. </p> <p> This edition is a completely updated and reorganized version of the previous text. In response to requests from reviewers and consumers, some of the chapters from the second edition have been combined in order to make room for additional material on other topics. Research literature on almost all aspects of infant development continues to expand. A new chapter on Perceptual Development has been added to reflect the burgeoning research and theoretical literature on infant sensory and perceptual capacities. Additional material on brain development has also been included. Each chapter has been extensively reviewed and carefully revised to include new information from theory and research. </p> <p> Following the format of the previous editions, the material is organized topically, with a chapter on each developmental area. One of the unique features of this text continues to be the extended coverage of physical development, including the latest growth charts. Although coverage of nutrition, health, and safety has been reduced somewhat, these topics continue to receive important emphasis. The text is devoted primarily to typically developing infants, but the coverage on infants with special needs continues to be an important emphasis. A concerted effort has been made to achieve a balance between theory, research, and practical information. Suggestions for enhancing infant growth and development are incorporated and highlighted in the various chapters. We have tried to use terminology that reflects caring, sensitivity, and respect for infants and families everywhere regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, culture, and developmental abilities. </p> <p> Through the years, numerous disciplines have contributed to our knowledge and understanding of infant development. This edition has been designed to retain the original interdisciplinary perspective. Information from child development and family relations, psychology, pediatrics, nursing, nutrition, biology, and other disciplines has been incorporated into the various chapters. The quotations from classical and contemporary literature that introduce each chapter are designed to add interest and express a major theme. We have tried to be objective in our coverage of infant development and base our conclusions on research and theory. If our coverage of any topic appears to be one-sided or uneven, it is due to an oversight rather than our own particular biases. </p> <p> Several features used in the book will facilitate student understanding and learning. An introduction at the beginning of each chapter summarizes the basic topics that are covered. Important terms are highlighted and ,carefully defined as they occur in the text and are listed at the end of each chapter. Real-life examples are used to illustrate difficult concepts. Photographs, drawings, and tables are sprinkled throughout the book to illustrate and summarize important information. References to Internet Web sites containing supplementary information on various topics in the text have been added. A summary of the main points under each major heading is included at the end of each chapter. </p> <p> In this edition, Cindy McGaha joins Charles Snow, the author of the first two editions, as coauthor. She is a rising young professional in the field of Child Development and Family Relations who has expertise in infant development and is especially interested in infants and young children with disabilities. </p></p><h2>Donald Judd</h2><p><p><b>An authoritative look at the art, life, and legacy of a revered artist</b><br><br> This pioneering, critically acclaimed book, originally published in 2010 and now available in paperback, is an authoritative and enlightening guide to a wide array of works by the great American artist Donald Judd (1928&#x2013;1994).&nbsp; Showcasing the entire breadth of Judd&#x2019;s practices, the book draws on documents from nearly twenty archives and investigates Judd and his work both within and outside the context of the 1960s Minimalist art movement. &nbsp;David Raskin explains why some of Judd&#x2019;s works seem startlingly ephemeral while others remain insistently physical; in the process of answering this perplexing question, Raskin traces Judd&#x2019;s principles from his beginnings as an art critic through his fabulous installations and designs in Marfa, Texas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Raskin develops a truly singular picture of Judd: he shows us an artist who asserted his individuality with spare designs; who found spiritual values in plywood, Plexiglas, and industrial production; who refused to distinguish between thinking and feeling while asserting that science marked the limits of knowledge; who claimed that his art provided intuitions of morality but not a specific set of tenets; and who worked for political causes that were neither left nor right.</p></p><p>&nbsp;This critically acclaimed monograph on Judd, now available in paperback, assesses the full scope of the artist&#x2019;s work and ideas.<br> &nbsp;<b>David Raskin</b> is Mohn Family Professor of Contemporary Art History at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><h2>Langenscheidt&#39;s German-English English-German Dictionary</h2><p>Newly revised and updated, this new edition of the classic dictionary incorporates hundreds of new words and reflects recent cultural, political and technological changes.

In this broadly synthetic work, distinguished historian Richard Brown shows that despite its founding statement that &#x201c;all men are created equal,&#x201d; the early Republic struggled with every form of social inequality. While people paid homage to the ideal of equal rights, this ideal came up against entrenched social and political practices and beliefs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brown illustrates how the ideal was tested in struggles over race and ethnicity, religious freedom, gender and social class, voting rights and citizenship. He shows how high principles fared in criminal trials and divorce cases when minorities, women, and people from different social classes faced judgment. This book offers a much-needed exploration of the ways revolutionary political ideas penetrated popular thinking and everyday practice.</p><p><b>Richard D.

Sir Moses Finley&#39;s exploration of politics in the city states of Greece and republican Rome yields insights into the arenas of political debate which have made a major impact on our understanding of the ancient world. The early political involvement of the free lower classes, the effect of war and conquest on political stability, and the ideological pressures which influenced the course of internal conflicts are salient themes in this stimulating investigation of the nature of government in Greece and Rome.</p><p>The business of politics offers us one of the most revealing areas of insight into any society.

In doing so, they continually present a clear discussion of child development and developmentally appropriate practices as they relate to the causes of children&#x2019;s behavior.&nbsp; Unique in providing a unified theory base for analyzing guidance and discipline, the text offers a consistent view of external versus internal motivation, explaining why rewards are as damaging as punishment, and why evaluative praise undermines children&#x2019;s learning as well as their self-confidence.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Keenly focused on developmental theory and constructivism,&nbsp;this celebrated resource explains underlying causes for child behavior, weaves numerous &nbsp;infant/toddler, preschool and primary classroom examples throughout, includes two full chapters devoted to challenges stemming from children with special physical or emotional needs, learning disabilities, or risk factors due to poverty, violence, or loss, and many summary boxes and graphic aids to prepare students in becoming experts in guiding young children.

He discusses the Korean War, the Cuban missile crisis, Vietnam War, and so on, not as discrete incidents--as many other books have done--but as interconnected confrontations in a long struggle that had to be fought. <i>The Fifty-Year War</i> is mostly a chronological history, with a special emphasis on cold-war weapons and technology. The bulk of the book focuses on the 1950s and 1960s; the 1980s receive only cursory attention, but they are in some sense the most dramatic, the moments when the cold war would turn suddenly hot. Still, Friedman credits Ronald Reagan with being the right man at the right time to ensure the Soviet Union's defeat. Indeed, the author believes the Communists were plainly beaten: "The West won the cold war. The Soviets did not merely lose interest in the competition. They lost the war, and they paid the usual price of defeat." This is a sound overview of a titanic struggle, especially its early period. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Norman Friedman is a prominent naval analyst and the author of more than thirty books covering a range of naval subjects, from warship histories to contemporary defense issues.

He is perhaps most famous for his series of Flashman novels, featuring his antihero Harry Flashman. In addition to his novels, he wrote numerous screenplays, most notably <i>The Three Musketeers</i> and the James Bond film <i>Octopussy</i>. George MacDonald Fraser died in 2008 at the age of 82.<i>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t wait to die on the field of honour. Heroes draw no higher wages than the others.&#x2019;</i> &#x2013; soldier of fortune Paolo di Avitabile in <i>Flashman</i><br><br>Just before World War I, Mark Franklin, the hero of George MacDonald Fraser&#x2019;s Mr American, travels to London, where he spends a bibulous evening with an elderly military man by the name of Sir Harry Paget Flashman. &#x2018;He had looked Sir Harry up in Who&#x2019;s Who and read incredulously through the succinct list of campaigns and decorations &#x2013; that gnarled old man sleeping there had seen Custer ride into the broken bluffs above the Little Big Horn, and fought hand to hand with Afghan tribesmen more than seventy years ago; he had ridden into the guns at Balaclava and seen the ranks form for Pickett&#x2019;s charge at Gettysburg; he had known Wellington and Lincoln . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Who wouldn&#x2019;t be incredulous? Sir Harry&#x2019;s numerous honors include not only England&#x2019;s Victoria Cross, but also the French Legion of Honour and the American Congressional Medal of Honor. His Who&#x2019;s Who entry &#x2013; should you ever happen upon it &#x2013; requires four inches of small type just to list some of his nearly unbelievable exploits. During the course of a long life, Sir Harry Paget Flashman (1822&#x2013;1915) served as a political adviser to Chancellor Bismarck on the Schleswig-Holstein question, briefly functioned as chief of staff to the Rajah of Sarawak, rode with both John Brown and Jeb Stuart, and even assisted the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as an aide-decamp. Over the years this far-ranging traveler also spent some time as a buffalo hunter, western scout, Australian prospector, &#x2018;reluctant deputy marshal to J. B. Hickok, Esq.,&#x2019; and native interpreter &#x2013; Sir Harry spoke nine languages fluently and could &#x2018;rub along&#x2019; in another dozen or so.<br><br>Naturally, Who&#x2019;s Who &#x2013; with British discretion &#x2013; barely hints that Harry Flashman frequently spied for Her Majesty&#x2019;s government and that he was mixed up in both the African slave trade and the Underground Railroad. Moreover, through a run of astonishing bad luck, the man seems to have landed smack in the middle of virtually every major battle or civil insurrection of the nineteenth century &#x2013; the Siege of Gandamack in Afghanistan, the Zulu attack at Rorke&#x2019;s Drift, the rising of the Mahdi at Khartoum, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Peking Rebellion of 1900. During the American Civil War he even inexplicably managed to serve as a major in the Union forces and a colonel in the army of the Confederacy.<br><br>As it happens, when Mr Franklin met Sir Harry the then 92- year-old general had recently completed his personal memoirs, memoirs so disturbing that after his death they were quickly sealed and, it would appear, instantly forgotten. Indeed, the memory of Sir Harry himself gradually faded away, so that otherwise reliable histories of the Victorian era failed to assign him even a footnote. But, then, in 1965 during a sale of household furniture at Ashby in Leicestershire, the manuscript miraculously resurfaced. Ably edited by George MacDonald Fraser, the so-called Flashman Papers were eventually published in twelve volumes, each &#x2018;packet&#x2019; focusing on one or more episodes from their author&#x2019;s martial career. They begin with the teenaged Flashman&#x2019;s expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness &#x2013; an incident mentioned in Thomas Hughes&#x2019;s almost libelous Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days &#x2013; and follow him up to the unpleasantness, very late in his life, with Colonel Sebastian &#x2018;Tiger Jack&#x2019; Moran. That last name may be familiar, as Moran was once described by the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes as &#x2018;the second most dangerous man in London&#x2019; and &#x2018;the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced&#x2019;.<br><br>But, really, what impropriety in these reminiscences could have offended the sensibilities of the Flashman family? The author was the most upright of eminent Victorians, the recipient of the San Serafino Order of Purity and Truth, the honorary president of the Mission for the Reclamation of Reduced Females, and the former governor of his alma mater, that bastion of muscular Christianity, Rugby School. Perhaps Sir Harry&#x2019;s family, in particular his clerical son, the Reverend<br>Bishop Harry Albert Victor Flashman, simply felt it wiser for posterity to honor a public career already well documented in Dawns and Departures of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life and &#x2019;Twixt Cossack and Cannon. Yet time has not been kind to these stiffly official memoirs. They are as forgotten now as if they had never existed, while great scholars and common readers alike return regularly to the Flashman Papers for instruction and delight. And, it goes without saying, for the irresistible brazen effrontery of the man himself. For in these memoirs, Sir Harry Flashman, the supposed Victorian equivalent of a &#x2018;parfit gentil knyght,&#x2019; reveals himself to be &#x2013; in his own words &#x2013; &#x2018;a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward &#x2013; and, oh yes, a toady.&#x2019;<br><br>In fact, Flashman is one of the world&#x2019;s most entertaining and beguiling rogues. He pursues life&#x2019;s pleasures with Casanovian gusto, regularly employs the colorful language of the barracks, and knows that &#x2018;there isn&#x2019;t any folly a man won&#x2019;t contemplate if there&#x2019;s money or a woman at stake.&#x2019; With his gallant sidewhiskers, bold dark eyes with hooded lids, and strong, aquiline nose, this charming dastard &#x2013; fourteen stone of sheer manliness &#x2013; regularly seduces schoolgirls and queens, hides or runs away when fights break out, and manages, through deception and utter poltroonery, to survive when better men die. As he says (in Royal Flash): &#x2018;The ideal time to be a hero is when the battle is over and the other fellows are dead, God rest &#x2019;em, and you take the credit.&#x2019;<br><br>The three startling, even shocking adventures reprinted in this Everyman omnibus provide the ideal introduction to Sir Harry&#x2019;s rumbustious life. In Flashman the youthful anti-hero spends his last day at Rugby, enlists in the army, captures the heart (and body) of the fair-haired Elspeth, and reluctantly embarks on a mission to mountainous, war-torn Afghanistan. In Flash for Freedom! the luckless Flashy joins the crew of an African slave ship, unwillingly assists the Underground Railroad, and fortuitously meets a rising young American politician named Abraham Lincoln. (In later years, Lincoln was known to say: &#x2018;When all other trusts fail, turn to Flashman.&#x2019; I believe that the word &#x2018;all&#x2019; should be emphasized.) Finally, Flashman in the Great Game takes our man into the world of Kim, as he spies for the British, dallies with a luscious maharani, and desperately struggles to survive the blood-baths of the Sepoy Mutiny.<br><br>That he does so will hardly come as a surprise, nor that he emerges from his Indian nightmare not only alive but also elevated to a knighthood. Nevertheless, a few crudely unimaginative critics have suggested that nobody could actually have escaped from so many deadly ambushes and battles. Two or three have even gone so far as to speculate that George Mac-DonaldFraser is&nbsp; the&nbsp; author, not the editor, of the Flashman Papers, with the deeply cynical implication that Flashman himself is merely a character in a series of clever novels. Sigh. What can you expect these days from cloistered academics, none of whom is even half as alive as Flashman?

An Appendix of Authors and Works provides additional factual information as well as selective surveys of recent bibliographies.The period from the eight to the fifth centuries B.C. was one of extraordinary creativity in the Greek-speaking world. Poetry was apublic and popular medium, and its production was closely related to developments in contemporary society. At the time when the city states were acquiring their distinctive institutions epic found the greatest of all its exponents in Homer, and lyric poetry for both solo and choral performance became a genre which attracted poets of the first rank, writers of the quality of Sappho, Alcaeus and Pindar, whose influence on later literature was to be profound. This volume covers the epic tradition, the didactic poems of Hesiod and his imitators, and the wide-ranging work of the iambic, elegiac and lyric poets of what is loosely called the archaic age.</p><h2>Programming Language Pragmatics</h2><p><p><i>Programming Language Pragmatics, Third Edition,</i> is the most comprehensive programming language book available today.

The fascinating elements of African life manifested themselves richly in the New World, and among the most lasting and influential of these was the art of African dance. This generously illustrated exploration of African American dance history follows the dynamics of the dance forms throughout each generation. Chapter 1 provides introductory information about the African continent and the heritage that spawned African American dance. Following is a discussion of the discrimination and marginalization endured by African Americans, and the fortitude with which the dance survived and became increasingly important in American culture. Chapters 2 and 3 explore black dance in the slavery era and the variety of black festivals and gatherings that helped to preserve and showcase African-based dance throughout the nineteenth century. Remaining chapters outline ten major characteristics that have consistently marked African American dance, and describe the various styles of black vernacular dance that became popular in America--the Ring Shout, Buzzard Lope, Cakewalk, Shimmy, Charleston, Black Bottom, Big Apple, Lindy Hop, and more. Chapter 8 concludes with a discussion of African dance at the end of the twentieth century and its important role in the flowering of African American arts.</p><p>Barbara S. Glass is the coordinator of the Minor in Professional Writing at Ohio State University. She lives in Xenia, Ohio.African dance traditions survived the diaspora and took root in American soil, flourishing and evolving with vigor and grace to make African American dance one of the world's most influential artistic forces. Glass, who combines zeal for her subject with scholarly ardor, defines key "African-derived dance characteristics," and charts the ingenious intermingling of African and European dance styles that resulted in such "quintessentially American" dances as the Charleston, shimmy, black bottom, and Lindy Hop. Interwoven in Glass' fascinating aesthetic discourse are eyebrow-raising disclosures of how racism impacted dance. The commentary is fresh and comprehensive, and the historic and revealing illustrations are astonishing in their coverage of the ring shout, the breakdown and buck dance (the roots of so many of today's moves), the bitter ironies of minstrel shows, the heyday of tap dancing, the cakewalk craze, the twist, break-dancing, and beyond. Glass profiles dozens of groundbreaking dancers, including Bert Williams and George Walker, Josephine Baker, Florence Mills, Bill Robinson, the Nicholas Brothers, and Chubby Checker, deepening appreciation for the power of dance. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In 1801, Lord Elgin, then ambassador to the Turkish government, had chunks of the frieze sawn off and shipped to England, where they were subsequently seized by Parliament and sold to the British Museum to help pay off his debts.<br><br>This scandal, exacerbated by the inept handling of the sculptures by their self-appointed guardians, remains unresolved to this day. In his fierce, eloquent account of a shameful piece of British imperial history, Christopher Hitchens makes the moral, artistic, legal and political case for re-unifying the Parthenon frieze in Athens.<br><br>The opening of the New Acropolis Museum emphatically trumps the British Museum&#x2019;s long-standing (if always questionable) objection that there is nowhere in Athens to house the Parthenon Marbles. With contributions by Nadine Gordimer and Professor Charalambos Bouras, <i>The Parthenon Marbles</i> will surely end all arguments about where these great treasures belong, and help bring a two-centuries-old disgrace to a just conclusion.</p><p><b>Christopher Hitchens</b> is a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i> and the author of the best-selling <i>God Is Not Great</i>.

Pragmatism and the Hispanic World examines the intersection between these two traditions, advancing new and unexplored realms of Western philosophy, and uncovering new relationships. It argues that, with respect to philosophical issues, there are fewer rifts and more affinity than is commonly thought between these two worlds.</p><p>The book will provide an invaluable source for philosophers and philosophy students, as well as for scholars from other disciplines (e.g., history, political science, sociology, diversity studies, and gender and race studies) to begin understanding the dynamic relationship in thinking between the two Americas. In additional to documenting the results of a new and thriving area of research, it can also function as a primer to direct and provoke further inquiry. </p><p>The volume is divided into three parts. First, the reception of the classical American Pragmatists within the Hispanic world is explored. Some of the essays argue for the inclusion of Hispanic figures in the history of pragmatism and therefore challenge the notion that pragmatism is a philosophy that is exclusively North American. Others put forth pragmatism as a philosophy that can contribute to dealing with the present social, ethical, or political problems experienced by Hispanics in and outside of the United States. These essays, from North American, Spanish, and Latin American scholars, fill a void in the humanities and introduce a number of Hispanic pragmatists, who are not included in standard pragmatists texts. </p><p>Altogether, the book questions gaps that never existed, building new bridges instead. It pioneers the way for a twenty-first-century dialogue between two great philosophical traditions.</p></p><p>Gregory Fernando Pappas is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Texas A&amp;M University and the author of John Dewey's Ethics: Democracy as Experience.This is indispensable reading for students and scholars of pragmatism as well as those working in Hispanic philosophy.

It describes how the evolution of both has been interactive and interdependent; the authors show that this can be explained in terms of the properties of the chemical elements and their compounds. The book discusses the physical and chemical balances between the animate and inanimate worlds, with kinetic and thermodynamic principles given to support this analysis. These principles are applied to both organic and inorganic chemical systems to provide a basis for understanding the evolution of life in terms of the interaction of both types of chemistry within ever more complex organizations. The book concludes with an examination of an intriguing problem: the long-term consequences of our manufacture and exploitation of chemicals. This intervention may be altering the symbiotic relationship between life and the environment, an issue of great concern to ecologists and biologists as well as those who study chemistry.</p><p>R. J.

It is the first volume in the Classics of the Radical Reformation, a series of Anabaptist and Free Church documents translated and annotated under the direction of the Institute of Mennonite Studies.</p><p>Michael Sattler was born sometime around 1490 at Stauffen in Breisgau. He entered the Benedictine Monastery of St. Peter&#39;s, northeast of Freiburg, where he became, by way of Lutheran and Zwinglian ides, to forsake the monastery and to marry, and by March, 1525, had become a member of the Anabaptist movement which had just begun at Zurich two months before.John Howard Yoder (1927-1997) taught ethics and theology as a professor at Notre Dame University and Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary. He received his doctorate from the University of Basel, Switzerland, and was a member of the Mennonite Church in Elkhart, Indiana.</p><h2>The Partition of Africa: And European Imperialism 1880-1900 (Lancaster Pamphlets)</h2><p><p>Much of the historical debate surrounding the partition of Africa, the events that led up to it and its implications for the continent itself and for the rest of the world is so controversial that it is difficult to provide a coherent survey of the shifting theories of the last twenty years.

While art historians place the origin of icons in the seventh century, Thomas F. Mathews finds strong evidence as early as the second century in the texts of Irenaeus and the Acts of John that describe private Christian worship. In closely studying an obscure set of sixty neglected panel paintings from Egypt in Roman times, the author explains how these paintings of the Egyptian gods offer the missing link in the long history of religious painting. Christian panel paintings and icons are for the first time placed in a continuum with the pagan paintings that preceded them, sharing elements of iconography, technology, and religious usages as votive offerings.<br> &nbsp;<br> Exciting discoveries punctuate the narrative: the technology of the triptych, enormously popular in Europe, traced by the authors to the construction of Egyptian portable shrines, such as the <i>Isis</i> and <i>Serapis</i> of the J. Paul Getty Museum; the discovery that the egg tempera painting medium, usually credited to Renaissance artist Cimabue, has been identified in Egyptian panels a millennium earlier; and the reconstruction of a ring of icons on the chancel of Saint Sophia in Istanbul.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book will be a vital addition to the fields of Egyptian, Graeco-Roman, and late-antique art history and, more generally, to the history of painting.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Thomas F.

But it is also a story about the impact of collectivization on the internal social relations and culture of the village, exploring questions of authority and leadership, feuds, denunciations, rumors, and changes in religious observance. For the first time, it is possible to see the real people behind the facade of the "Potemkin village" created by Soviet propagandists. In the Potemkin village, happy peasants clustered around a <em>kolkhoz</em> (collective farm) tractor, praising Stalin and promising to produce more grain as a patriotic duty. In the real Russian village of the 1930s, as we learn from Soviet political police reports, sullen and hungry peasants described collectivization as a "second serfdom," cursed all Communists, and blamed Stalin personally for their plight.<br> Sheila Fitzpatrick's work is truly a landmark in studies of the Stalinist period--a richly-documented social history told from the traumatic experiences of the long-suffering underclass of peasants. Anyone interested in Soviet and Russian history, peasant studies, or social history will appreciate this major contribution to our understanding of life in Stalin's Russia.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sheila Fitzpatrick</strong> is Bernadotte E.

This is an empirical and conceptual tour de force."--Ronald Grigor Suny, The University of Michigan<p></p><br>"Sheila Fitzpatrick has written yet another path-breaking book, introducing us once more to an untold history and hitherto unused sources. She shows that Stalin's peasants were unmistakably kin to the peasants of Peter and Catherine, and the two Nicholases.

Revealing interviews with Hugh Hefner and his daughter (and later <i>Playboy</i> CEO) Christie Hefner, as well as with a number of editors and even Playmates, show that even as the magazine continued to present a romanticized notion of gender difference, it again and again demonstrated a commitment to equality and expanded opportunities for women.</p><p><br>Offering a surprising new take on a twentieth-century icon, <i>Bachelors and Bunnies</i> goes beyond the smoking jacket and the centerfold to uncover an unlikely ally for the feminist cause. </p></p><p><p><b>Carrie Pitzulo</b> is assistant professor of history at the University of West Georgia. </p><p>&#x201c;<i>Playboy</i> has always been a puzzling and complicated cultural phenomenon and its publisher, Hugh Hefner, a troubling icon.&nbsp;Carrie Pitzulo here takes a fruitful second look at the magazine and provides a fresh interpretation of the man and his empire of sex.&#x201d;</p> (James Gilbert, author of Men in the Middle)<br><br><p>&#x201c;In this eye-opening study, Carrie Pitzulo turns conventional wisdom on its head.

Traveling far beyond the traditional bounds of mathematics and science to the distant shores of popular culture, this wave captures the attention and enthusiasm of a worldwide audience. The fourteen chapters of this book cover the central ideas and concepts of chaos and fractals as well as many related topics including: the Mandelbrot Set, Julia Sets, Cellulair Automata, L- systems, Percolation and Strange Attractors. Each chapter is closed by a &#34;Program of the Chapter&#34; which provides computer code for a central experiment. Two appendices complement the book. The first, by Yuval Fisher, discusses the details and ideas of fractal images and compression; the second, by Carl J.G. Evertsz and Benoit Mandelbrot, introduces the foundations and implications of multifractals.</p><p>Fascinating and authoritative, <i>Chaos and Fractals: New Frontiers of Science</i> is a truly remarkable book that documents recent discoveries in chaos theory with plenty of mathematical detail, but without alienating the general reader. In all, this text offers an extremely rich and engaging tour of this quite revolutionary branch of mathematical research.<p> The most appealing aspect about <i>Chaos and Fractals</i> has to be its hundreds of images and graphics (with dozens in full-color) used to illustrate key concepts. Even the math-averse reader should be able to follow the basic presentation of chaos and fractals here. Since fractals often mimic natural shapes such as mountains, plants, and other biological forms, they lend themselves especially well to visual representation.</p><p> Early chapters here document the mathematical oddities (or "monsters") such as the Sierpinski Gasket and the Koch Curve, which laid the groundwork for later discoveries in fractals. The book does a fine job of placing recent discoveries about chaos into a tradition of earlier mathematical research. Its description of the work of mathematicians like Pascal, Kepler, Poincar�, Sierpinski, Koch, and Mandelbrot makes for a fine read, a detective story that ends with the discovery of <i>order</i> in chaos. (For programmers, the authors provide short algorithms and BASIC code, which lets you try out plotting various fractals on your own.) </p><p> This is not, however, only a book of pretty pictures. For the reader who needs the mathematics behind chaos theory, the authors in no way dumb down the details. (But because the richer mathematical material is set off from the main text, the general reader can still make headway without getting lost.)</p><p> There have been advances in the field since this book's publication in 1992, but <i>Chaos and Fractals</i> remains an authoritative general reference on chaos theory and fractals. A must for math students (and math enthusiasts), <i>Chaos and Fractals</i> also deserves a place on the bookshelf of any general reader or programmer who wants to understand how today's mathematicians and scientists make sense of our world using chaos theory. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Overview of fractals and chaos theory, feedback and multiple reduction copy machines (MRCMs), the Cantor Set, the Sierpinski Gasket and Carpet, the Pascal Triangle, the Koch Curve, Julia Sets, similarity, measuring fractal curves, fractal dimensions, transformations and contraction mapping, image compression, chaos games, fractals and nature, L-systems, cellular automata basics, attractors and strange attractors, Henon's Attractor, R�ssler and Lorenz Attractors, randomness in fractals, the Brownian motion, fractal landscapes, sensitivity and periodic points, complex arithmetic basics, the Mandelbrot Set, and multifractal measures.</p><p>&#x201c;It is relatively discursive and easy to read, with each chapter telling a coherent story, and it highlights the key concepts and ideas, examining a few models in detail and using worked numerical examples as well as visualisations and illustrations ... . makes an excellent entry to the broader mathematics of fractals and chaos, especially for students who are curious about the details as well as the core concepts but don&#x2019;t want to get bogged down in formal mathematics.&#x201d; (Danny Yee, Danny Yee&#x2019;s Book reviews, February, 2016)</p> <p>"It is one of the best introductions to chaos and fractals around. ...

Here they speak for themselves, providing the reasons for belief that prompted these accomplished men and women to embrace the ancient faith.<br> &nbsp;<br> Included are interviews with a bishop, a leading theologian and priest, a member of the International Theological Commission, a former megachurch pastor, a prominent pro-life scholar, professors from Harvard and other universities, as well as journalists and writers, novelists and scholars. Each are interviewed by another leading scholar, many of whom are themselves converts and familiar with the hesitations, anxieties, discoveries, and hopes of those who discover the Faith.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> These conversion stories remind us that the Catholic Church retains her vitality, able to provide answers and reasons for hope to new generations of believers, always sustained by the Holy Spirit. It is all too-easy to become discouraged in our day and age, but God never fails to call people to Himself, as evidenced by these remarkable stories.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Robert P.

This textbook describes mechanisms that underlie plant physiological ecology at the levels of physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology. At the same time, the integrative power of physiological ecology is well suited to assess the costs, benefits, and consequences of modifying plants for human needs and to evaluate the role of plants in ecosystems.</p> <p></p> <p><em>Plant Physiological Ecology, Second Edition</em>&nbsp;is significantly updated, with full color illustrations and begins with the primary processes of carbon metabolism and transport, plant water relations, and energy balance. After considering individual leaves and whole plants, these physiological processes are then scaled up to the level of the canopy. Subsequent chapters discuss mineral nutrition and the ways in which plants cope with nutrient-deficient or toxic soils. The book then looks at patterns of growth and allocation, life-history traits, and interactions between plants and other organisms. Later chapters deal with traits that affect decomposition of plant material and with the consequences of plant physiological ecology at ecosystem and global levels.</p> <p></p> <p><em>Plant Physiological Ecology,&nbsp;Second Edition</em>&nbsp;features numerous boxed entries that extend the discussions of selected issues, a glossary, and numerous references to the primary and review literature. This significant new text is suitable for use in plant ecology courses, as well as classes ranging from plant physiology to plant molecular biology. </p> <p><em>From reviews of the first edition:</em></p> <p><em>"</em>. . . the authors cover a wide range of plant physiological aspects which up to now could not be found in one book. . . . The book can be recommended not only to students but also to scientists working in general plant physiology and ecology as well as in applied agriculture and forestry." -&nbsp;<em>Journal of Plant Physiology</em></p> <p>"This is a remarkable book, which should do much to consolidate the importance of plant physiological ecology as a strongly emerging discipline. The range and depth of the book should also persuade any remaining skeptics that plant physiological ecology can offer much in helping us to understand how plants function in a changing and complex environment." - <em>Forestry</em></p> <p>"This book must be regarded as the most integrated, informative and accessible account of the complexities of plant physiological ecology. It can be highly recommended to graduate students and researchers working in all fields of plant ecology." -&nbsp;<em>Plant Science</em></p> <p>". . . there is a wealth of information and new ideas here, and I strongly recommend that this book be on every plant ecophysiologist's shelf. It certainly represents scholarship of the highest level, and many of us will find it a useful source of new ideas for future research." - <em>Ecology</em></p><p><strong>Hans Lambers</strong> is Professor of Plant Ecology and Head of School of Plant Biology, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Western Australia. <strong>F.

More than anyone else, his blend of scepticism, caustic wit and sharp prose defines a certain American mythos. While his novel <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> is still taught to anyone who attends school and is considered by many to be the Great American Novel, Twain's shorter stories and criticisms have unequalled style and bite.<br><br>In a review that's less than kind to the writing of James Fenimore Cooper, Twain writes: "Every time a Cooper person is in peril, and absolute silence is worth four dollars a minute, he is sure to step on a dry twig. There may be a hundred handier things to step on, but that wouldn't satisfy Cooper. Cooper requires him to turn out and find a dry twig; and if he can't do it, go and borrow one." It's difficult to imagine anyone else writing in quite this style, which is why Twain's legacy only continues to grow.</p></p><p><p>Mark Twain, who was born Samuel L. Clemens in Missouri in 1835, wrote some of the most enduring works of literature in the English language, including <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> and <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>. <em>Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc</em> was his last completed book&#x2014;and, by his own estimate, his best. Its acquisition by Harper &amp; Brothers allowed Twain to stave off bankruptcy. He died in 1910.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Discourse Strategies (Studies in Interactional Sociolinguistics, Series Number 1)</h2><p>To understand the role of language in public life and the social process in general, we need first a closer understanding of how linguistic knowledge and social factors interact in discourse interpretation. This volume is a major advance towards that understanding. Professor Gumperz here synthesizes fundamental research on communication from a wide variety of disciplines - linguistics, sociolinguistics, anthropology and non-verbal communication - and develops an original and broadly based theory of conversational inference which shows how verbal communication can serve either between individuals of different social and ethnic backgrounds. The urgent need to overcome such barriers to effective communication is also a central concern of the book. Examples of conversational exchanges as well as of longer encounters, recorded in the urban United States, village Austria, South Asia and Britain, and analyzed to illustrate all aspects of the analytical approach, and to show how subconscious cultural presuppositions can damagingly affect interpretation of intent and judgement of interspeaker attitude. The volume will be of central interest to anyone concerned with communication, whether from a more academic viewpoint or as a professional working, for example, in the fields of interethnic or industrial relations.</p><p>Fundamental research on communication from a wide variety of disciplines is synthesized to develop an original and broadly based theory of conversational inference, showing how verbal communications can reinforce or overcome barriers between social and ethnic groups.The volume will be of central interest to anyone concerned with communication, whether from a more academic viewpoint or as professionals working, for example, in the fields of interethnic or industrial relations.</p><h2>Democracy and Education</h2><p>John Dewey&#39;s &#34;Democracy and Education&#34; addresses the challenge of providing quality public education in a democratic society. In this classic work Dewey calls for the complete renewal of public education, arguing for the fusion of vocational and contemplative studies in education and for the necessity of universal education for the advancement of self and society. First published in 1916, &#34;Democracy and Education&#34; is regarded as the seminal work on public education by one of the most important scholars of the century.</p><p>John Dewey(1859 1952) was anAmerican philosopher, psychologistandeducational reformerwhose ideas have been influential in education and social reform. Dewey was an important early developer of the philosophy ofpragmatismand one of the founders offunctional psychology. He was a major representative ofprogressive educationandliberalism.In 1894 Dewey joined the newly foundedUniversity of Chicago(1894 1904) where he developed his belief in an empirically based theory of knowledge, becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitledThought and its Subject-Matter, which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective titleStudies in Logical Theory(1903). During that time Dewey also initiated theUniversity of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education, The School and Social Progress(1899).In 1899, Dewey was elected president of theAmerican Psychological Association. From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at both Columbia Universityand Columbia University&#39;sTeachers College.In 1905 he became president of theAmerican Philosophical Association. He was a longtime member of theAmerican Federation of Teachers.</p><h2>Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human</h2><p><p>Millions of people around the world today spend portions of their lives in online virtual worlds. Second Life is one of the largest of these virtual worlds. The residents of Second Life create communities, buy property and build homes, go to concerts, meet in bars, attend weddings and religious services, buy and sell virtual goods and services, find friendship, fall in love--the possibilities are endless, and all encountered through a computer screen. <i>Coming of Age in Second Life</i> is the first book of anthropology to examine this thriving alternate universe.</p><p> Tom Boellstorff conducted more than two years of fieldwork in Second Life, living among and observing its residents in exactly the same way anthropologists traditionally have done to learn about cultures and social groups in the so-called real world. He conducted his research as the avatar "Tom Bukowski," and applied the rigorous methods of anthropology to study many facets of this new frontier of human life, including issues of gender, race, sex, money, conflict and antisocial behavior, the construction of place and time, and the interplay of self and group.</p><p><i>Coming of Age in Second Life</i> shows how virtual worlds can change ideas about identity and society. Bringing anthropology into territory never before studied, this book demonstrates that in some ways humans have always been virtual, and that virtual worlds in all their rich complexity build upon a human capacity for culture that is as old as humanity itself.</p></p><p><p>"Tom Boellstorff describes Second Life warmly and intelligently, highlighting its issues in a thought-provoking manner that is always backed up with evidence. There's an almost tangible depth to his analysis that makes it really stand out. This is just the kind of portrait of a virtual world that I've been waiting to see for years: a full-blooded, book-length tour de force."--<b>Richard A. Bartle, author of <i>Designing Virtual Worlds</i></b></p><p>"This is the first book to take a sustained look at an environment like Second Life from a purely anthropological perspective. It is sure to become the basis for a new conversation about how we study these spaces. It is impossible to read this book and not come away asking questions about how our lives are being transformed in very real ways by what is happening in the virtual."--<b>Douglas Thomas, author of <i>Hacker Culture</i></b></p><p>"Taking the bold step of conducting ethnographic fieldwork entirely 'inside' Second Life, Tom Boellstorff invites readers to meditate on the old and new meanings of the virtual and the human. He presses the inventive and compelling claim that anthropologists would do well to imagine culture itself as already harboring the notion of the virtual. Boellstorff argues that being 'virtually human' is what we have been all along."--<b>Stefan Helmreich, author of <i>Silicon Second Nature</i></b></p><b>Tom Boellstorff</b> is professor of anthropology at the University of California, Irvine.

Each sonnet is presented with accompanying material which aims to enrich your own experience of the poem, whilst leaving you to make your own mind up about the sonnet rather than having someone else&#39;s interpretation and judgement handed down to you. You will find help with unfamiliar words, with imagery, and with other &#39;poetic&#39; features, as well as suggestions for practical work.Shakespeare's sonnets, the greatest of Elizabethan sonnet sequences, were first published in an unauthorized version in 1609. William Shakespeare was then forty-five years old, a successful playwright, a country gentleman, and an affluent member of the Globe, the most important theatrical enterprise in London.<br>Although the sonnets are among the finest poems in the English language, questions about them have preoccupied scholars for several hundred years. This edition portrays the sonnets in the order and sequence thought to be traditional.<br>This edition of the sonnets also includes imaginative, flowing illustrations of Charles Robinson. One of the most popular of Edwardian artists, he was acclaimed for his highly original coloring and flights of fantasy. His illustrations add an unusual dimension to the sonnets, which are unequalled in their poetic power, exploration of intimate human relationships, and sensitivity to tragedy of human aspirations.</p><h2>Marriage Conflicts: Resources for Strategic Pastoral Counseling</h2><p>All types of marriage dysfunction covered, using short-term counseling model, with case studies.

Is Earth so rare that advanced life forms like us--or even the simplest biological organisms--are unique to the universe? <i>How to Find a Habitable Planet</i> describes how scientists are testing Sagan's prediction, and demonstrates why Earth may not be so rare after all.</p><p> James Kasting has worked closely with NASA in its mission to detect habitable worlds outside our solar system, and in this book he introduces readers to the advanced methodologies being used in this extraordinary quest. He addresses the compelling questions that planetary scientists grapple with today: What exactly makes a planet habitable? What are the signatures of life astronomers should look for when they scan the heavens for habitable worlds? In providing answers, Kasting explains why Earth has remained habitable despite a substantial rise in solar luminosity over time, and why our neighbors, Venus and Mars, haven't. If other Earth-sized planets endowed with enough water and carbon are out there, he argues, chances are good that some of those planets sustain life. Kasting describes the efforts under way to find them, and predicts that future discoveries will profoundly alter our view of the universe and our place in it.</p><p> This book is a must-read for anyone who has ever dreamed of finding other planets like ours--and perhaps even life like ours--in the cosmos. In a new afterword, Kasting presents some recent breakthroughs in the search for exoplanets and discusses the challenges facing space programs in the near future.</p></p><p><p>"A fascinating read--everything you need to know about habitable worlds."<b>--Sara Seager, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"I very much enjoyed reading this book.

While the book presents the classic canon of Renaissance painting and sculpture in full, it expands the scope of conventional surveys by offering a more through coverage of architecture, decorative and domestic art, and print media. Rather than emphasizing artists&#x2019; biographies, this new account concentrates on the works, discussing means of production, the place for which images were made, concerns of patrons, and the expectation and responses of the works first viewers. Renaissance art is seen as decidedly new, a moment in the history of art whose concerns persist in the present. 790 full-color illustrations</p><p><p><b>Stephen J.

Although Handel's autographs and performing scores have long been available, they have never before been fully studied, still less the very early manuscript copies. The manuscripts have yielded a great deal of unknown music, besides throwing fresh light on Handel's methods of composition and performance practice.<br> This book covers Handel's first seventeen surviving operas, including his greatest and most successful. Each opera has a chapter, with a full synopsis of the libretto (including all original stage directions) and a comparison with its literary and dramatic sources. Each chapter covers the history of the opera in performance and the different versions in the manuscripts. Every known surviving manuscript has been examined. Eight appendices cover all performances in Handel's time, borrowings, modern revivals, new information on his singers, and a complete index of Italian first lines in all Handel's works.

Soviet authorities undoubtedly had the means to exterminate all the prisoners who passed through the Gulag, but unlike the Nazis they did not conceive of their concentration camps as instruments of genocide. In this provocative book, Steven Barnes argues that the Gulag must be understood primarily as a penal institution where prisoners were given one final chance to reintegrate into Soviet society. Millions whom authorities deemed "reeducated" through brutal forced labor were allowed to leave. Millions more who "failed" never got out alive.</p><br><p> Drawing on newly opened archives in Russia and Kazakhstan as well as memoirs by actual prisoners, Barnes shows how the Gulag was integral to the Soviet goal of building a utopian socialist society. He takes readers into the Gulag itself, focusing on one outpost of the Gulag system in the Karaganda region of Kazakhstan, a location that featured the full panoply of Soviet detention institutions. Barnes traces the Gulag experience from its beginnings after the 1917 Russian Revolution to its decline following the 1953 death of Stalin.</p><br><br><p> <i>Death and Redemption</i> reveals how the Gulag defined the border between those who would reenter Soviet society and those who would be excluded through death.</p></p><p><br><p>"The Gulag has been deployed as the central metaphor of the Soviet experiment. In many ways, it was the brutal double of the Stalinist system as a whole, as it combined violence and social transformation simultaneously. In this compelling and illuminating book, Barnes examines the vast prison and camp system literally from top to bottom. He brings to life a world of horror and despair perversely aimed at founding a transcendent society."<b>--Ronald Grigor Suny, University of Michigan</b><br></p><br><p>"<i>Death and Redemption </i>is a work of major scholarly significance. Barnes demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the workings of ideology in Soviet penal practice as well as a mastery of the sources. This wide-ranging study brings to light for the first time in English the vast variety of penal institutions that fell under the jurisdiction of the Gulag, and grounds the Gulag within the broader history of the Soviet Union."<b>--Lynne Viola, author of<i>The Unknown Gulag</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"<i>Death and Redemption</i> provides an extraordinarily rich account of the Gulag that goes far beyond traditional views of life in the camps to show how it mirrored and recreated the hierarchies and tensions of broader Soviet society. When all is said and done, this is a brilliant book. Readers, both general and scholarly, will find material for thought here, supported by careful documentation and excellent, absolutely first-rate analysis."<b>--Elizabeth A. Wood, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b><br></p><br><p>"This well-written, well-researched book frames the Gulag in an original and compelling manner. Barnes argues that the Gulag must be seen as part of the Soviet state's overall ideological project, and that one component of this project was the use of the camp system to redeem through labor those who could be redeemed. He casts our understanding of the Gulag, and the Stalinist period generally, in a new light."<b>--Peter Holquist, University of Pennsylvania</b><br></p><br><b>Steven A.

She marries a kind but dull country doctor and discovers that "This life of hers was as cold as an attic that looks north; and boredom, quiet as the spider, was spinning its web in the shadowy places of her heart." Emma Bovary's quest for escape from the emptiness of her bourgeois existence leads to infidelity and financial extravagance, and Gustave Flaubert's powerful and deeply moving examination of her moral degeneration is universally regarded as a landmark of nineteenth-century fiction.<br>Flaubert was brought to trial by the French government on the grounds of this novel's alleged immorality but narrowly escaped conviction. <i>Madame Bovary</i> remains a touchstone for literary discussions of provincial life and adultery as well as a summit of prose art, a pioneering work of realism that forever changed the way novels are written. This complete and unabridged edition features the classic translation by Eleanor Marx-Aveling.</p><p>This exquisite novel tells the story of one of the most compelling heroines in modern literature--Emma Bovary. Unhappily married to a devoted, clumsy provincial doctor, Emma revolts against the ordinariness of her life by pursuing voluptuous dreams of ecstasy and love. But her sensuous and sentimental desires lead her only to suffering corruption and downfall. A brilliant psychological portrait, <i>Madame Bovary</i> searingly depicts the human mind in search of transcendence. Who is Madame Bovary? Flaubert's answer to this question was superb: "Madame Bovary, c'est moi." Acclaimed as a masterpiece upon its publication in 1857, the work catapulted Flaubert to the ranks of the world's greatest novelists. This volume, with its fine translation by Lowell Bair, a perceptive introduction by Leo Bersani, and a complete supplement of essays and critical comments, is the indispensable <i>Madame Bovary</i>.The year 1857 propelled Flaubert into the law courts and into celebrity. It was not exactly the kind of celebrity he had wished for. &#39;Madame Bovary&#39; had appeared serially in &#39;La Revue de Paris&#39;. Now the imperial prosecutor was attacking the work for being offensive to religion and morality. Not only the seduction scenes, but the episodes dealing with religion and the description of Emma&#39;s death, came under direct censure. More than the subject, the general tone of the novel was denounced as immoral: the pervasive eroticism, the poetry of adultery, the so-called &#39;realism&#39; of the style. Flaubert, excellently defended by his lawyer, was acquitted. The book was published soon after, benefiting from the advance courtroom publicity.</p><h2>A Commentary on Horace: Odes, Book II (Clarendon Paperbacks)</h2><p>This commentary provides the reader with the background knowledge of conventional forms and topics needed to appreciate fully every aspect of the poems.

Will be useful both as a learning tool and as a reference for C++.</p><p>I was both pleasantly surprised and gratified to find the first edition of the C++ Primer enthusiastically received by the C++ community. When my editor suggested a second edition, my first reaction was, "What? Already?" However, the conditions seemed as propitious as those surrounding the first edition: my wife and I were expecting a child again (this time a girl, Anna Rachel); I was again working long hours trying to get out a new release of the compiler (this time, Release 3.0); and again, the C++ language had significantly evolved (this time, the template facility and a published exception handling specification). Okay, then. "But I want it to be a better edition, not just an update," I told my editor, my wife, my colleagues at work, and just about anyone who would listen. "Oh," they said, their voice muted, eyes cast downward to the street, carpet, meal. "Well, don't ruin it," they advised. <p> BACKGROUND ON C++ </p><p> The C++ programming language was developed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is an evolution of the C programming language, which extends C in three important ways: </p><p> It provides support for creating and using data abstractions It provides support for object-oriented design and programming It provides various nice improvements over existing C constructs all while retaining C's simplicity of expression and speed of execution. </p><p> C++ is already widely available and is in wide use for real application and systems development. Within six months of its initial release from AT&amp;T in late 1985, there were commercial ports of C++ available on over 24 systems, ranging from PCs to large mainframes. Since then, more ports have been made, and C++ is now available directly from many computer vendors. In 1988 the first native compilers were produced for the PC and workstation markets. Additionally, large-scale libraries and program support environments have begun to appear. The maturation of the C++ language is attested to by two recent events: the formation of an ANSI C++ committee and the publication of THE ANNOTATED C++ REFERENCE MANUAL by Ellis and Stroustrup, which serves as the baseline document for the C++ ANSI committee. Papers documenting user experience with C++ have appeared in various conferences (there are now two annual conferences devoted exclusively to C++) and technical publications. </p><p> STRUCTURE OF THIS BOOK This book provides a comprehensive introduction to C++ as reflected in its latest release, Release 3.0, and the baseline ANSI C++ document, THE ANNOTATED C++ REFERENCE MANUAL by Ellis and Stroustrup. Additionally, it provides a consciously tutorial appraoch to describingthe C++ language. Knowledge of C is not assumed, although familiarity with some modern, block structured language is. This book is intended as a first book on C++; it is not intended as a first book on programming! </p><p> Much of the power of C++ comes from its support for new ways of programming and new ways of thinking about programming problems. Learning to use C++ effectively, therefore, requires more than simply learning a new set of syntax and semantics. To facilitate this larger learning, the book is organized around a series of extended examples. These examples are used both to introduce the details of various language features, and to motivate them as well. By learning language features in the context of a full example, it becomes clear why such features are useful, providing a sense of when and how one would make use of them for real world problem solving. Additionally, this focus on examples, which can and should be executed, allows early use of concepts that will be explained more fully as the reader's knowledge base is built up. Early examples can and do contain simple uses of fundamental C++ concepts, giving a flavor for the kinds of programming one can do in C++ without requiring complete understanding of the details of design and implementation. </p><p> Fundamental to C++ are various facilities that allow the user to extend the language itself by defining new data types that then can be used with the flexibility and simplicity of built-in data types. The first step to mastery is to understand the base language itself. Chapters 0 through 4 focus on the language at this level, while Chapters 5 through 9 extend the discussion of the facilities which support creation of user-defined types. Chapter 10 provides a tutorial illustration of the process of object-oriented design in C++. </p><p> Chapter 0 introduces the essential elements of a C++ program and the details of how to get a C++ program entered and executed. Data types, expressions and statements are the subject of Chapters 1 and 2. Chapter 1 includes a discussion and example of the C++ class introducing this fundamental notion that will be expanded on throughout the book. Chapter 3 introduces functions, the notion of program scope, and the run-time allocation of variables through the use of a program's free store. Proficient programmers--and especially C prgrammers--may be tempted to skip these chapters. Don't. New concepts are included throughout these sections and even the most experienced C programmer will benefit from skimming the material and working through the examples in the text and the exercises. </p><p> Chapter 4 extends the discussion to encompass function overloading and the definition and use of template functions. Overloading allows multiple function instances that provide a common operation (but require differing implementations) to share a common name. The programmer can write put ( ) rather than putc ( ) or puts ( ) , for example, and trust the compiler to resolve the call to the intended instance. A template function provides a prescription for the automatic generation of an infinite set of function instances varying by type but whose implementation remains invariant. </p><p> Chapters 5 and 6 focus on the class mechanism and how it supports the design and implementation of abstract data types. By creating new types to describe the problem domain, C++ allows the programmer to write applications with much less concern for the various bookkeeping aspects that make programming tedious. The implementation of types fundamental to the application can be implemented once and reused, allowing the programmer to concentrate on the problem rather than the details of the implementation. Facilities for encapsulating the data can dramatically simplify subsequent maintenance and change. </p><p> Chapter 7 examines the definition and use of the template class facility. Template classes facilitate the development of extensive class libararies. As with a template function, a template class provides a prescription for the automatic generation of an infinite set of class instances varying by type but whose implementation remains invariant. </p><p> Object-oriented programming and the facilities in C++ that support it are the topics of Chapters 8 and 9. Chapter 8 introduces inheritance. Through inheritance, the programmer can capture type relationships that are interdependent. The classic example is that of shapes. All shapes share certain attributes: location on the plane, logic to rotate the shape, draw the shape, etc. Inheritance allows these common attributes to be shared from the application's viewpoint while the implementation of each specific shape need worry only about providing definitions for those attribures that actually differ from one shape to the next. Fundamental to object-oriented approaches is the ability to choose at run time which exat function will be invoked. For example, at run time we must be able to tell a shape to rotate and know that the appropriate logic for a circle or square will be invoked depending on the actual type of the shape that is being rotated. In C++ this is handled through the virtual function mechanism, which is the topic of Chapter 9. Chapter 9 also introduces the more complicated inheritance hierarchies that are made possible through virtual base classes. Chapter 10 provides a tutorial illustration of object-oriented design using C++. </p><p> CHANGES TO THE SECOND EDITION</p><p> The changes to the second edition fall into four general categories: Coverage of new features added to the language: the template facility and exception handling. Adjustments in the existing test to reflect refinements, changes, and extensions in the existing language. An example of a refinement is the small change in the rules for the initialization of a reference. This in turn modified slightly the argument-matching algorithm forthe resolution of a call of an overloaded function. An example of a large change in the language is the introduction of nested types within classes. (A discussion of how nested types were "reintroduced" into C++ can be found in my article "Nested Types in C++," published in the C++ Journal, Fall, 1</p>Third Edition<br>now available! <p>C++ Primer was widely regarded as the most effective introduction to the C++ programming language. The new edition covers C++ as reflected in its latest release, Release 3.0, and the ANSI base document, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual, by Ellis and Stroustrup. As a leading member of the team working on the implementation of Realease 3.0, Lippman provides invaluable insights into the new language features. </p><p> The most important new addition to the C++ language is the template facility, a feature that facilitates the development of extensive class and algorithmic libraries. Lippman provides comprehensive coverage of this new feature, including a rich variety of examples showing how templates can be used effectively. Features </p><p><br>* Includes a new chapter on object-oriented design, using as an example the implementation of a template facility in a C++ compiler. <br>* Covers exception handling, now a formal part of the C++ language. <br>* Discusses the differences betweeen the Realease 2.0 and Release 3.0 language definition. <br> </p><p> C++ PRIMER, SECOND EDITION is useful both as a learning tool and as a reference to C++. It assumes only an understanding of the basic constructs of a programming language.

The author of <b>Invisible Man </b>wrote widely and brilliantly on his favorite music for more than fifty years, immersing himself in the lives and works of America's musicians, some of whom were his close friends. Ellison is, in fact, perhaps the most important jazz analyst we have. <b>In Living with Music</b>, celebrated jazz authority Robert G. O'Meally has collected the very best of Ellison's writings on this subject; each selection vibrant, insightful, and bursting with Ellison's love of the music in this unique and original anthology.<br><br>For readers who think they know Ellison's work, this book will be a revelation. For music fans, it is an essential addition to the jazz bookshelf. Selections include the famous <i>Homage to Duke Ellington on His Birthday, The Golden Age, Time Past, On Bird, Bird-Watching, and Jazz</i>, letters to Albert Murray about Louis Armstrong, and O'Meally's 1976 interview with Ellison. In these pages, Ellison reflects on the greats, from Charlie Parker to Duke Ellington, and meditates on jazz classics in a style that will make even casual fans of the genre hear the music in a whole new way. <b>In Living with Music</b>, we see firsthand the resounding and profound influence that jazz and Ralph Ellison; two American originals, riffing, improvising, and conversing on a truly profound level, have had on our culture.</p><p>"In the swift whirl of time music is a constant, reminding us of what we were and of that toward which we aspire. Art thou troubled? Music will not only calm, it will ennoble thee."<br>Ralph Ellison was born in Oklahoma City in 1914. He was educated at the Frederick Douglass School and at Tuskegee Institute, where he studied the trumpet and music composition.

The sixth edition of this dynamic book has been updated and revised throughout, with a shorter length and a more streamlined focus. Updates include material on China and Hindu South Asia combined into a single chapter, a new chapter assessing the imperial world and the breakdown of states, and new examples throughout.<br><br>In this introduction to the basic concepts of cultural anthropology, Bodley challenges students to consider &#x201c;big questions&#x201d; about the nature of cultural systems:<br><br><ul><li>What is &#x201c;natural&#x201d; and what is &#x201c;cultural&#x201d; about humans?</li><li>What is it like to be human under different cultural conditions, and how do socio-cultural systems of different cultural scales satisfy basic human needs?</li><li>Are race, language, and environment determinants of culture?</li><li>What are the human costs and benefits of socioeconomic growth?</li><li>What have been the major turning points in human history?</li><li>What role do individuals play in shaping culture?</li></ul><br>Employing a scale and power approach, the text examines a representative sampling of the world&#x2019;s major cultural areas and dominant civilizations, from Australian Aborigines, Amazonia, and East African pastoralists to Pacific Islanders, Mesopotamia, China, Hindu India, the British Empire, and the United States; these cultures are shown in depth, as adapting, integrated systems&#x2014;and as part of regional, continental, and global systems. He concludes the text with a wide-ranging assessment of human problems in the contemporary commercial world, emphasizing inequality, poverty, environmental degradation, and sustainability.<br><br>A complimentary instructor&#x2019;s manual, test bank, and companion website are available to enhance teaching and learning.

He is author of several books, including Victims of Progress and Anthropology and Contemporary Human Problems, both now in sixth editions, as well as The Power of Scale and The Small Nation Solution.John Bodley&#x2019;s Cultural Anthropology stands well apart from many other introductory texts. It combines sweeping perspective and grand narrative with wide-ranging cross-cultural and historical data to provide a clearly focused anthropological perspective on our modern world. Bodley does more than introduce anthropology; he shows students how to apply it. (Joshua S. Levin, College of Southern Nevada)<br><br>John Bodley's text is solid, incisive, and wise. He puts anthropology into the context of the social sciences, enabling teachers and students alike to grasp its relevance in the world to come. (Michael Blim, City University of New York)<br><br>John Bodley&#x2019;s textbook, now in its sixth edition, is by far the best introductory survey of cultural anthropology ever published! It offers integrated, thorough, and balanced topical and regional coverage of the diversity and unity of humankind; scientific and humanistic aspects; materialist and mentalist approaches; enduring traditional and recent contemporary questions, problems, and issues; theories and methods; and the ethnographic and comparative dimensions of scale, power, and other attributes of tribal, state, and global systems. Bodley challenges students to think critically about their generally unexamined beliefs and practices. In an increasingly interconnected world, this is a vital read not only for every student majoring in anthropology, but ideally for any informed citizen. (Leslie Sponsel, University of Hawai`i, author of Spiritual Ecology: A Quiet Revolution)<br><br>Bodley's analysis and writing is completely accessible and empowering. This sixth edition of Cultural Anthropology is thoughtful, with examples relevant to the times, and engages the reader from the first page to the last. I especially appreciate the consistent structure of each chapter&#x2014; identifying and discussing the central concepts up front rather than burying definitions and detail in an endnote; situating the learning in larger stories that illustrate the life of an anthropologist and the many reasons why an anthropology of power matters; and concluding each chapter with suggestions for how the reader can further apply the lessons in this chapter in their own life as a student and beyond. Simply put, this is an elegant and teachable text that will both inform and inspire.

Wherever human beings share a language, they also strive to make from it something new: a cryptic idiom, built from the grammar that they know, which will allow them to communicate in secrecy. Such hidden languages come in many shapes. They may be playful or serious, children's games or adults' work. They may be as impenetrable as foreign tongues, or slightly different from the idioms from which they spring, or barely perceptible, their existence being the subject of uncertain, even unlikely, suppositions.<br> It was in the Renaissance that writers across Europe first noted that willfully obscure languages had come into use. A varied cast of characters -- lawyers, grammarians, and theologians -- denounced these new forms of speech, arguing that they were tools of crime, plotted in tongues that honest people could not understand. Before the emergence of these modern jargons, however, the artificial twisting of languages served a different purpose. In epochs and regions as diverse as archaic Greece and Rome and medieval Provence and Scandinavia, singers and scribes also invented opaque varieties of speech. They did so not to defraud, but to reveal and record a divine thing: the language of the gods, which poets and priests alone were said to master.<br> <i>Dark Tongues</i> moves among these various artificial and hermetic tongues. From criminal jargons to sacred idioms, from Saussure's work on anagrams to Jakobson's theory of subliminal patterns in poetry, from the arcane arts of the Druids and Biblical copyists to the secret procedure that Tristan Tzara, founder of Dada, believed he had uncovered in Villon's songs and ballads,<i> Dark Tongues</i> explores the common crafts of rogues and riddlers, which play sound and sense against each other.<br><br> <b></b><br> <b></b><br> <b></b><br> <b></b></p><p>"I am one of many poets who have considered Daniel Heller-Roazen's books essential reading ever since&nbsp;<i>Echolalias</i>. Once again, in&nbsp;<i>Dark Tongues</i>, he evinces his accustomed depth and range of intelligence and scholarship. His aphoristic prose style, with its sense of mischief and wit, reaches its apogee in this meditation on rogues, riddlers, linguists and poets. Heller-Roazen continues his exploration into almost buried tongues, illuminated by his belief in the power and mystery of poetry. He is the Joycean juggler of words and letters constantly in motion, shifting with twists and turns that yield to, yet resist even the most erudite of interpretations."&nbsp;<br> Susan Howe, author of&nbsp;<i>That This</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Souls of the Labadie Tract</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> "Daniel Heller-Roazen's brilliance and originality, the depth and range of his scholarship, are inspiring: if you loved (as I did) Heller-Roazen's archaeology of the vanished in&nbsp;<i>Echolalias</i>, you will love this book too. Dark Tongues is aimed at readers fascinated by the ways of words, language, and its users. Here is God's post-Babel plenty.&nbsp;<i>Dark Tongues</i>&nbsp;is a rare and delectable treat."<br> Roberta Frank, Marie Borroff Professor of English, Yale University<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> "In this brilliant book, Heller-Roazen descends into the half-world of literary history to which rogue and riddling poets have been exiled.

The book is an insider's behind-the-scenes look at the arcane, fascinating world of theoretical and experimental particle physics leading up to the recent discovery of a new boson. If the new boson is indeed the Higgs particle, its discovery represents an important milestone in the history of particle physics. However, despite the pressure to award Nobel Prizes to physicists associated with the Higgs boson, John Moffat argues that there still remain important data analyses to be performed before uncorking the champagne.<br><br>John Moffat is Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Toronto and a senior researcher at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. Well-known for his outside-the-box research on topics such as dark matter, dark energy, and the varying speed of light cosmology (VSL), his new book takes a critical look at the hype surrounding the Higgs boson. In the process, he presents a cogent and often entertaining history of particle physics and an exploration of alternative theories of particle physics that do not feature the Higgs boson, including his own. He gives a detailed and personal description of how theoretical physicists come up with new theories, and emphasizes how carefully experimental physicists must interpret the complex data now coming out of accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).<br><br>The book does not shy away from controversial topics such as the sociology of particle physics. There is immense pressure on projects like the $9 billion LHC to come up with positive results in order to secure funding for the future. Yet to date, the Higgs boson may be the only positive result to emerge from the LHC experiments. The searches for dark matter particles, mini-black holes, extra dimensions, and supersymmetric particles have all come up empty-handed, with serious consequences for theoretical physics, including string theory and gravity theory.<br><br>John Moffat is also the author of <em>Reinventing Gravity</em> (2008) and <em>Einstein Wrote Back</em> (2010).<br></p><p><br>John W. Moffat has been a professor of physics for more than three decades. He is currently Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto, a member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, and adjunct professor in the physics department at the University of Waterloo. Moffat is well known for his alternative theory of gravity to Einstein's general relativity. He is the author of <em>Reinventing Gravity: A Physicist Goes Beyond Einstein </em>and <em>Einstein Wrote Back: My Life in Physics</em>.<br><br>"John Moffat's book is an unusual mixture of scientific writing, detective story, and romance. It takes us on a very personal quest of understanding the nature of the new particle discovered at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012, highlighting the drama leading to this major discovery and the author's own alternative theoretical views challenged by the ATLAS and CMS experiment data. The author cleverly mixes scientific sections with a day-to-day account of the events that led to the discovery of the Higgs Boson and its aftermath. This is delightful reading for anyone interested in big science and theoretical ideas that led to the development of the standard model of particle physics. It is a passionate personal account of one of the most significant discoveries in particle physics of the past few decades." --<em>Greg Landsberg, Brown University, CMS Physics Coordinator 2012-2013</em><p></p><br>"John Moffat has written a fascinating insider's account of the international struggle of theoretical and experimental physicists to understand the origin of mass, and to develop a simple unified theory of fundamental forces. Unlike most popular books, which focus on just the leading theory, <em>Cracking the Particle Code</em> describes how a plethora of competing ideas arose over the last five decades and how a combination of intuition, mathematical reasoning, and extraordinary technology is being applied to decide the issue." --<em>Paul Steinhardt, Albert Einstein Professor in Science, Princeton</em> <em>University</em><p></p><br>"There are many books on the market that describe the Higgs boson discovery. This book's uniqueness is its author's uncompromising drive to question both theory and experiment." --<em>London Times Higher Education</em><p></p><br>"For a picture of the global nature and excitement of the Higgs discovery, we turn to <em>Cracking the Particle Code of the Universe</em>. Moffat does not hold back on his engagement." --<em>Physics Today</em><p></p><br>"Moffat's new book is a well-done and well-written survey of the history, achievements, and shortcomings of the Standard Model of particle physics. It will equip the reader with all the necessary knowledge to put into context the coming headlines about new discoveries at the LHC and future colliders." --<em>Physics World</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Introduction to Global Politics: Third Edition</h2><p><p>The fully updated third edition of <i>Introduction to Global Politics </i>continues to provide a vital resource for students looking to explain global politics using an historical approach, firmly linking history with the events of today.

Lewis</h2><p><p>Marking the 50th anniversary of Lewis&#x2019; death, <i>The Intellectual World of C. S.

S. Lewis</em> </b></p> <p>I began a substantial research project on CS Lewis (1898-1963) after moving from Oxford University to take up a newly established professorship at King's College London in September 2008. My new position allowed me more time for research. Having read much by (and about) Lewis, I decided to write a major new study of Lewis to mark the 50th anniversary of his death in 2013. As the research proceeded, I realized that I would have to write two works on Lewis to cope with its significant findings. The first was a new biography of Lewis, entitled <em>C. S. Lewis &#x2013; A Life. Reluctant Prophet, Eccentric Genius</em>, published in February 2013, which has been very well received. The second is <em>The Intellectual World of C. S. Lewis</em>. </p> <p>This second book provides eight meticulously researched studies of aspects of Lewis's thought that have not received the attention that they deserve to date. Four of them break new ground &#x2013; especially the essays dealing with the literary character of Lewis's autobiographical work Surprised by Joy, and Lewis's extensive use of imagery based on sight and light. Although these are solid pieces of research, I have made them as accessible as possible. <em>The Intellectual World of C. S. Lewis</em> is an ideal companion to the biography. The latter tells a story; the former unpacks some core ideas in Lewis's thought. </p> <p>So what will readers get out of <em>The Intellectual World of C. S. Lewis</em>? Taken together, these eight essays will allow readers to get much more out of their engagement with Lewis. For example, the essay on Lewis's approach to "myth" will helps readers make sense of (and appreciate) some core features of the famous "Chronicles of Narnia". The essay on Lewis's visual imagery helps make sense of many themes in <em>Mere Christianity</em>, and some of his most famous essays, especially "The Weight of Glory" and "Meditation in a Toolshed". Lewis's elegant style and accessible prose masks the conceptual profundity of his thinking. <em>The Intellectual World of C. S. Lewis</em> will allow Lewis's readers to appreciate the depth of his ideas, while still enjoying the winsome way in which they are presented. </p><p>The 50th anniversary of Lewis&#x2019; death sees the work of this exceptional author as relevant today as ever, and his theological writings, which continue to have a wide and devoted following, remain immensely influential. Although not a professional theologian, Lewis&#x2019; work is widely accepted as having developed significant theological themes. <i>The Intellectual World of C. S. Lewis,</i> written by leading Christian thinker and bestselling author Alister McGrath, explores eight key aspects of Lewis&#x2019; intellectual development and importance. Based on new research, this fascinating volume uncovers some original and important insights relating to the major themes of his work.</p> <p>With a single authorial voice throughout, these essays bear the hallmark of McGrath&#x2019;s widely respected scholarly, and yet accessible style. McGrath throws fresh light on each subject, and offers new connections as he addresses key themes at the centre of C. S. Lewis&#x2019; work, including his intellectual development, the uses of images in literature and theology, the place of myth in modern thought, the role of the imagination in making sense of the world, the celebrated &#x2018;argument from desire&#x2019;, and Lewis&#x2019; place as an Anglican thinker and a Christian theologian.</p></p><h2>The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not an Instinct</h2><p>Language is central to our lives, the cultural tool that arguably sets us apart from other species. Some scientists have argued that language is innate, a type of unique human &#39;instinct&#39; pre-programmed in us from birth. In this book, Vyvyan Evans argues that this received wisdom is, in fact, a myth. Debunking the notion of a language &#39;instinct&#39;, Evans demonstrates that language is related to other animal forms of communication; that languages exhibit staggering diversity; that we learn our mother tongue drawing on general properties and abilities of the human mind, rather than an inborn &#39;universal&#39; grammar; that language is not autonomous but is closely related to other aspects of our mental lives; and that, ultimately, language and the mind reflect and draw upon the way we interact with others in the world. Compellingly written and drawing on cutting-edge research, The Language Myth sets out a forceful alternative to the received wisdom, showing how language and the mind really work.</p><p>Language is central to our lives, the cultural tool that arguably sets us apart from other species.

And relatively few African American and Latino/a high school students receive the kind of institutional encouragement, educational opportunities, and preparation needed for them to choose computer science as a field of study and profession. In Stuck in the Shallow End, Jane Margolis looks at the daily experiences of students and teachers in three Los Angeles public high schools: an overcrowded urban high school, a math and science magnet school, and a well-funded school in an affluent neighborhood. She finds an insidious &#x201c;virtual segregation&#x201d; that maintains inequality. Two of the three schools studied offer only low-level, how-to (keyboarding, cutting and pasting) introductory computing classes. The third and wealthiest school offers advanced courses, but very few students of color enroll in them. The race gap in computer science, Margolis finds, is one example of the way students of color are denied a wide range of occupational and educational futures. Margolis traces the interplay of school structures (such factors as course offerings and student-to-counselor ratios) and belief systems&#x2015;including teachers' assumptions about their students and students' assumptions about themselves. Stuck in the Shallow End is a story of how inequality is reproduced in America&#x2015;and how students and teachers, given the necessary tools, can change the system.</p></p><p>Jane Margolis is a Senior Researcher at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies and the coauthor of <i>Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing</i> (MIT Press). She was a 2016 White House Champion of Change for her work addressing underrepresentation of students of color and women in computer science.<p>Students of color may be stuck on the educational 'shallow end' now, [Margolis] writes, but it is possible to end their segregation through systemic reform.</p>&#x2015;<i>Education Week</i></p><h2>Criminal Procedure: From First Contact to Appeal (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <i>This comprehensive text uses a real world focus to </i> <i>cover all of criminal procedure, from first contact to appeal.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Criminal Procedure: From First Contact to Appeal, 5e </b>is a comprehensive introduction to criminal procedure, from first contact with the police, all the way through to appeal.

Professor de Broglie, on the other hand, has been led to a view of the wave-particle duality of matter that is completely different from that of the Copenhagen School. In this volume he reviews the interpretation of wave mechanics that he proposed earlier under the name of the Theory of the Double Solution, and also discusses his most recent work on this subject. In particular, he stresses the importance of introducing the random element, which corresponds to the hypothesis of the subquantum medium of Bohm and Vigier, into the theory. The author&#39;s main purpose, however, is to undertake a thorough criticism of the orthodox interpretation, bringing to light its inadequacies and obscurities, and to review the paradoxes arising from them. In so doing he expresses his conviction that the usual formalism, thought strict in appearance and generally leading to precise conclusions, does not provide a profound and convincing explanation of the physical reality on the sub-microscopic. This profound discussion should greatly stimulate all those interested in the formation of an intelligible concept of the phenomena of quantum physics.</p><p></p><h2>Corporate Strategy: A Resource-Based Approach</h2><p>Corporate Strategy by Collis and Montgomery employs a single consistent framework for the analysis of corporate-level strategy. Based on the latest research in the resource-based view of the firm and organizational economics, it develops a rigorous approach to the many important issues surrounding the scope of the firm. Starting from the analysis of how valuable resources contribute to the competitive advantage of a single business, the book progresses through the analysis of scale, scope and vertical integration within an industry, to the treatment of diversification and the management of multi-business firms. As such, it perfectly complements those required strategy courses that develop the notions of strategy as the internal consistency and external positioning of single business firms.

On one side are those who oppose involuntary psychiatric treatments under any condition. Activists who take up this cause often don&#x2019;t acknowledge that psychiatric symptoms can render people dangerous to themselves or others, regardless of their civil rights. On the other side are groups pushing for increased use of involuntary treatment. These proponents are quick to point out that people with psychiatric illnesses often don&#x2019;t recognize that they are ill, which (from their perspective) makes the discussion of civil rights moot. They may gloss over the sometimes dangerous side effects of psychiatric medications, and they often don&#x2019;t admit that patients, even after their symptoms have abated, are sometimes unhappy that treatment was inflicted upon them.</p><p>In <i>Committed</i>, psychiatrists Dinah Miller and Annette Hanson offer a thought-provoking and engaging account of the controversy surrounding involuntary psychiatric care in the United States. They bring the issue to life with first-hand accounts from patients, clinicians, advocates, and opponents. Looking at practices such as seclusion and restraint, involuntary medication, and involuntary electroconvulsive therapy&#x2015;all within the context of civil rights&#x2015;Miller and Hanson illuminate the personal consequences of these controversial practices through voices of people who have been helped by the treatment they had as well as those who have been traumatized by it.</p><p>The authors explore the question of whether involuntary treatment has a role in preventing violence, suicide, and mass murder. They delve into the controversial use of court-ordered outpatient treatment at its best and at its worst. Finally, they examine innovative solutions&#x2015;mental health court, crisis intervention training, and pretrial diversion&#x2015;that are intended to expand access to care while diverting people who have serious mental illness out of the cycle of repeated hospitalization and incarceration.

Newly revised and updated, this indispensable guide includes more case examples and adds seven ways &#x201c;to fail&#x201d; with child patients, too.</p><p><i>How to Fail...</i> details how to avoid errors such as not recognizing limitations, performing incomplete assessments, ignoring science, ruining the client relationship, setting improper boundaries, terminating improperly, therapist burnout, and more.</p></p><p>The Practical Therapist Series� -- books for practicing psychotherapists, written by distinguished professionals. Emphasizing clear, straightforward language, each book offers practitioners expert information and understanding of the theory and techniques of a specific approach to psychotherapy.&#34;To make a long story short, what had started as an analysis of therapeutic failure had led to an increased awareness of the clinical practices which lead to higher rates of client retention, satisfaction and therapeutic success. Our book, &#34;How to Fail as a Therapist&#34; is a modest attempt to share these approaches with others - and by doing so create a glass which is neither half empty or half full - but one that is in the process of being filled.&#34;</p><h2>How Institutions Think: Between Contemporary Art and Curatorial Discourse (The MIT Press)</h2><p><b>Reflections on how institutions inform art, curatorial, educational, and research practices while they shape the world around us.</b><br>Contemporary art and curatorial work, and the institutions that house them, have often been centers of power, hierarchy, control, value, and discipline. Even the most progressive among them face the dilemma of existing as institutionalized anti-institutions. This anthology--taking its title from Mary Douglas's 1986 book, <i>How Institutions Think</i>--reconsiders the practices, habits, models, and rhetoric of the institution and the anti-institution in contemporary art and curating. Contributors reflect upon how institutions inform art, curatorial, educational, and research practices as much as they shape the world around us. They consider the institution as an object ofienquiry across many disciplines, including political theory, organizational science, and sociology.<br>Bringing together an international and multidisciplinary group of writers, <i>How Institutions Think </i>addresses such questions as whether institution building is still possible, feasible, or desirable; if there are emergent institutional models for progressive art and curatorial research practices; and how we can establish ethical principles and build our institutions accordingly. The first part, "Thinking via Institution," moves from the particular to the general; the second part, "Thinking about Institution," considers broader questions about the nature of institutional frameworks.<br><b>Contributors include</b>Nata&#x161;a Petre&#x161;in Bachelez, Dave Beech, M�lanie Bouteloup, Nikita Yingqian Cai, Binna Choi and Annette Kraus, Pip Day, Cl�mentine Deliss, Keller Easterling and Andrea Phillips, Bassam El Baroni, Charles Esche, Patricia Falgui�res, Patrick D.

He was the first Cuban Caudillo &#x2013; the man who freed his country from dependence on the USA and who lead his people to rediscover their national identity and pride. <br> <p>Castro has outlived generations of American presidents and Soviet leaders. He has survived countless assassination attempts by the CIA, the Mafia, and Cubans living in exile. He has become one of the greatest politicians of the 20th Century. His biography, and the history of his country exemplify the tensions between East and West, North and South, rich and poor.<br> </p> <p>As Castro's life draws to a close, the question as to what will become of Cuba is more important that ever. Will Castro open Cuba to economic reform and democratization, or stick to his old slogan socialism or death?</p> <p>In this remarkable, up-to-date reconstruction of Castro's life, Volker Skierka addresses these questions and provides an account of the economic, social, and political history of Cuba since Castro's childhood. He draws on a number of little-known sources, including material from the East German communist archives on Cuba, which were until recently inaccessible.</p> <p>This is an exciting, painstakingly researched, and authortiative account of the life of one of the most extraordinary political figures of our time.</p></p><p><b>Volker Skierka</b> is a journalist and author based in Germany."A comprehensive and highly readable biography written in a remarkably even-handed tone."<br> <i><b>The Guardian</b></i><br> <p>"Volker Skierka has written the book that those wanting to understand the present-day politics of Cuba and its ruler have been awaiting for a long time.

In graduate school, he became fascinated with the Everglades, both academically and personally. In addition to publishing magazine articles on the Everglades, he wrote and directed an educational film ("The Everglades Region, An Ecological Study", John Wiley and Sons, 1973), and published on the fishes of the region. After receiving his Ph.D., he became an environmental consultant, specializing in wetlands and aquatic ecosystems. Dr. Lodge still works as a consultant, with two recent examples being a reassessment of Everglades restoration options in a team effort with The Everglades Foundation and protection of Grassy Waters Preserve, part of the historic Loxahatchee Slough.

James's evolving metaphysical enquiries, from The Principles of Psychology through his later radical empiricist phase, his opposition to absolute idealism, and his religious motivation are all carefully elucidated. After outlining Bradley's metaphysical system, Sprigge scrutinizes Bradley's use of 'The Absolute', critically evaluates Russell's criticisms of Bradley, compares Bradley's phenomenology with Husserl's, and considers Bradley's view of the displacement of Christian morality by Darwinism.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p>Professor Timothy Sprigge teaches philosophy at the University of Edinburgh.</p><h2>Introduction to Spoken Standard Arabic: A Conversational Course on DVD, Part 2</h2><p><p>This text-and-DVD package can be used to improve the conversational skills of second- to third-semester beginning Arabic students.

Also discussed in these chapters are the kinetics and statistics of polymerization with a separate chapter on the characterization of chain structure by spectroscopic methods.<br><br>The next part of the text deals with chain conformation, structure and morphology, leading to a discussion of crystallization, melting and glass transition. The discussion then moves from solid state to solution properties where solution thermodynamics is introduced. This provides the basis for discussion of the measurement of molecular weight by various solution methods.<br><br>The final chapter deals with mechanical and rheological properties, which are discussed from a phenomenological continuum approach and then in terms of a fundamental molecular perspective.<br><br>Altogether, the text provides a comprehensive, lucid introduction to today's polymer science as a foundation to the R&amp;D of polymeric materials. More than 200 schematics and other figures illustrate key concepts and important aspects of polymeric materials.

Personal overviews by John Searle and Bernard Williams establish an emphasis on developments over recent decades. <p>The <i>Companion</i> functions primarily as a flexible and distinctive introductory textbook, but even advanced students will welcome its stimulating and accessible chapters and the guidance provided by cross references, glossary entries, boxed highlights, bibliographies, discussion questions, and further reading.</p></p><p><b>Nicholas Bunnin</b> studied at Harvard university and Corpus Crhisti College, Oxford.

People outside that tradition will find the initial essays by John Searle and Bernard Williams bumptious. The book does contain a brief but intelligent essay on Continental philosophy by David E. Cooper and an essay on feminist philosophy by Jean Grimshaw, which gives many recent French feminists their due (though it ignores Helene Cixous). Kant, Hegel, and Marx get brief look-ins, and the ancient philosophers and the medievals get a chapter each. The early moderns-from Descartes and Hobbes to Hume-get 80 pages. This leaves 600 pages for the Anglo-American philosophers, from the pragmatists onward, of which 480 are devoted to recent analytic philosophers and their backgrounds. These essays, mostly by well-established authors, are of very high quality. A.C. Grayling on epistemology and Simon Blackburn on metaphysics are especially enlightening. Mary Tiles on the philosophy of mathematics is not only clear on a difficult subject but breaks through the philosophical parochialism of some of the other discussions. Leon Pompa's essay on the philosophy of history is an unusually good introduction to the subject.

James Twitchell traces our fascination with horror from the cave paintings at Lascaux to the "slasher" movies today.<br> Twitchell finds that three particular stories have had a special resonance in our culture: the bloodsucker (<em>Dracula</em>), the deformed creature (<em>Frankenstein</em>), and the transformation monster (<em>The Wolfman, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>). Why have these stories persisted to the point of becoming mythic and to the exclusion of others? Whatever happened to the Phantom of the Opera or the Hunchback of Notre Dame or the Creature from the Black Lagoon? Using a psychoanalytic approach, Twitchell argues that the stories we seek out and preserve are th ones that carry certain information as well as horror. These myths, he contends, warn their adolescent audiences of the dangers of careless sexual behavior: they seem to say--subliminally--that sex itself is not horrible, but sex with certain people is.<br> Whether discussing the engravings of William Hogarth or <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,</em> Twitchell is consistently insightful, provocative, and entertaining. Film buffs and scholars literary critics and devotees of the Gothic novel will all welcome this study.<br><em>About the Author</em>:<br>James B.

ISBN 0-252-01208-9. $24.95. film/lit The new academic respectability of popular culture is on prominent display in these fascinating studies of 19th- and especially 20th-century horror narratives. Both writers bring an impressive array of persepectivespsychoanalytic, literary critical, anthropologicalto bear on novels and films that demonstrate our continuing fascination with abominations. Twitchell's scope is the broader one. Developing ideas about monstrosity he first suggested in the more narrowly literary The Living Dead (Duke, 1981), he attempts an anatomy of modern horror by focussing on the original appearances and subsequent reincarnations of Dracula, Frankenstein, and what he calls ``the transformation monster.'' Twitchell's anatomy is ultimately psychoanalytic: we create and re-create these monsters to remind us all of the dangers of incestan argument which is not fully convincing, but always stimulating. Waller confines himself to variations on the vampire story (with Dracula as the model), which he defines as confrontations between the living and the undead. For him, these narratives (mostly films) can be considered together as a ``genre,'' one which constantly redefines itself both in relation to previous tellings and to the ongoing history of the culture which produces it. For Waller, vampire stories are finally about human ``survival,'' a slightly reductive conclusion to a book which frequently displays great subtlety and insight in interpreting these narratives (especially the films) both individually and as a genre.

His exceptionally complex structure and techniques make Thucydides one of the most difficult as well as one of the most profound of ancient historians. Professor Rusten aims to assist students at all levels in learning to read Thucydides. The text, in Greek, is supported by a valuable introduction and commentary in English. In his commentary, Rusten scrutinizes the historical, literary, and philosophical aspects. The introduction surveys biographical interpretations of the text, suggests a new approach to fictive elements in the speeches, and sketches the main features of Thucydidean style.</p><p>Thucydides (c. 460 BC400 BC) was a general who was exiled for his failure to defend the Greek city of Amphipolis in Thrace.

What about other epistemic values like understanding and certainty? Why are so many epistemologists worried about luck? In ON EPISTEMOLOGY Linda Zagzebski situates epistemological questions within the broader framework of what we care about and why we care about it. Questions of value shape all of the above questions and explain some significant philosophical trends: the obsession with answering the skeptic, the flight from realism, and the debate between naturalism and anti-naturalism. THE WADSWORTH PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS SERIES (under the general editorship of Robert Talisse, Vanderbilt University) presents readers with concise, timely, and insightful introductions to a variety of traditional and contemporary philosophical subjects. With this series, students of philosophy will be able to discover the richness of philosophical inquiry across a wide array of concepts, including hallmark philosophical themes and themes typically underrepresented in mainstream philosophy publishing. Written by a distinguished list of scholars who have garnered particular recognition for their excellence in teaching, this series presents the vast sweep of today&#39;s philosophical exploration in highly accessible and affordable volumes. These books will prove valuable to philosophy teachers and their students as well as to other readers who share a general interest in philosophy.</p><p>Linda Zagzebski is Kingfisher College Chair of the Philosophy of Religion and Ethics and George Lynn Cross Research Professor at the University of Oklahoma.

Haskell argues for a moderate historicism that acknowledges the force of perspective and reaffirms the pluralistic practices of a liberal democratic society -- even while upholding time-honored distinctions between fact and fiction, scholarship and propaganda, right and might. Haskell addresses questions that will interest philosophers and literary theorists no less than historians, exploring topics ranging from the productivity of slave labor to the cultural concomitants of capitalism, from John Stuart Mill's youthful "mental crisis" to the cognitive preconditions that set the stage for antislavery and other humanitarian reforms after 1750. He traces the surprisingly short history of the word responsibility, which turns out to be no older than the United States. He examines the reasons for the rising authority of professional experts in nineteenth-century America. And he wonders whether the epistemological radicalism of recent years leaves us with any adequate basis for justifying human rights--rights of academic freedom, for example, or the right not to be tortured. </p><p>Written by a thoughtful critic of the historical profession, Objectivity Is Not Neutrality calls upon historians to think deeply about the nature of historical explanation and to acknowledge more fully than ever before the theoretical dimension of their work.</p></p><p><p>Thomas L.

Thereis no bigger or more important issue in America than youth violence. Kids, some as young as ten years old, take up arms with the intention to murder. Why is this happening? Lt. Col. Dave Grossman and Gloria DeGaetano believe the root cause is the steady diet of violent entertainment kids see on TV, in movies, and in the video games they play&#x2014;witnessing hundreds of violent images a day. Offering incontrovertible evidence based on recent scientific studies and research, they posit that this media is not just conditioning children to be violent and see killing as acceptable but teaching them the mechanics of killing as well.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill</i> supplies the statistics, interprets the copious research that exists on the subject, and suggests the many ways to make a difference in your home, at school, in your community, in the courts, and in the larger world.

It was first written down in Western Europe in the eighth to ninth centuries. Many thousands of chants have been sung at different times or places in a multitude of forms and styles, responding to the differing needs of the church through the ages. This book provides a clear and concise introduction, designed both for those to whom the subject is new and those who require a reference work for advanced study. It begins with an explanation of the liturgies that plainchant was designed to serve. It describes all the chief genres of chant, different types of liturgical book, and plainchant notations. After an exposition of early medieval theoretical writing on plainchant, Hiley provides a historical survey that traces the constantly changing nature of the repertory. He also discusses important musicians and centers of composition.

Doing so, it bridges the traditional gap between theoretical and empirical research and offers an integrated framework for studying applied problems in macroeconomics and microeconomics.</p><p>In part I the authors first review the formal theory of dynamic optimization; they then present the numerical tools and econometric techniques necessary to evaluate the theoretical models. In language accessible to a reader with a limited background in econometrics, they explain most of the methods used in applied dynamic research today, from the estimation of probability in a coin flip to a complicated nonlinear stochastic structural model. These econometric techniques provide the final link between the dynamic programming problem and data. Part II is devoted to the application of dynamic programming to specific areas of applied economics, including the study of business cycles, consumption, and investment behavior. In each instance the authors present the specific optimization problem as a dynamic programming problem, characterize the optimal policy functions, estimate the parameters, and use models for policy evaluation.</p><p>The original contribution of <i>Dynamic Economics: Quantitative Methods and Applications</i> lies in the integrated approach to the empirical application of dynamic optimization programming models. This integration shows that empirical applications actually complement the underlying theory of optimization, while dynamic programming problems provide needed structure for estimation and policy evaluation.</p></p><p>J�r�me Adda is a Lecturer in the Department of Economics at University College, London, and a Research Associate at the Institute of Fiscal Studies.--Paul D.

If you don&#x2019;t accept that observation, try making any one of the following comments around the break room at work, or even in the Sunday-school room at church:<br><br>� &#x201c;Only Christians will go to heaven; everyone else is going to hell.&#x201d;<br><br>� &#x201c;The husband is the head of the family.&#x201d;<br><br>� &#x201c;Homosexuality is a perversion.&#x201d;<br><br>Then just sit back and watch the fireworks explode! You&#x2019;ll most likely hear the terms intolerant, bigot, uneducated, and arrogant hurled at you (and those are just some of the nicer words you can expect). By the way, don&#x2019;t be surprised if you hear such harsh judgments coming just as frequently and forcefully from the lips of Christians as from non-Christians. In increasing numbers believers are either abandoning or holding much less tightly to the truths that have been historically embraced by Christians. Such a charge certainly demands support, so let me offer some from both personal experience and statistical evidence. First, my story.<br><b>Big Stink in a Small Town</b><br><br>I pastor a large church in a medium-size town two hours away from Dallas, Texas. Situated right in the middle of the Bible Belt, our church has been described by Christianity Today as the new &#x201c;Mecca&#x201d; of evangelical Christianity. A few years ago a member of our church brought me copies of two children&#x2019;s books from our local library: Daddy&#x2019;s Roommate and Heather Has Two Mommies. Both books tell the story of a child being raised by a homosexual couple. In Daddy&#x2019;s Roommate, a young boy&#x2019;s parents divorce so that &#x201c;Daddy&#x201d; can live with his homosexual lover, Frank. The little boy is understandably perplexed by the relationship and asks his mother about his father&#x2019;s new &#x201c;friend.&#x201d; The mother gently explains that &#x201c;being gay is just one more kind of love&#x201d; and that &#x201c;Daddy and his roommate are very happy together.&#x201d;1 When the little boy asks what Daddy and Frank do, Mom explains that Daddy and Frank live together, eat together, and sleep together. Each activity the mother explains is accompanied by a drawing, including one showing Daddy and Frank together in bed.2<br><br>It just so happened that the week the books were brought to my attention, my sermon&#x2013;part of a series on the book of Genesis&#x2013;was on God&#x2019;s destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. One of the applications I made at the close of the message was that no society can afford to condone what God has condemned and that there comes a time when Christians need to take a stand against evil. I read from Daddy&#x2019;s Roommate and focused on the picture of two men in bed together. &#x201c;Here is a library book&#x2013;purchased with your tax dollars&#x2013;promoting sodomy, which is illegal in the state of Texas, is largely responsible for one of the deadliest epidemics in history (AIDS), and is an abomination to God....<br><br>It is time for God&#x2019;s people to say, &#x2018;Enough!&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>I explained that I had already spoken with the librarian about removing the books, but she had refused to do so. So I asked our church to petition the city council to remove the books. To make it easier for the city council, I also decided not to return the books to the library so that the council&#x2019;s decision would be whether or not to repurchase the books I was keeping. (I later wrote a check to the library to cover the cost of the books.)<br><br>I could never have imagined the firestorm that ignited as a result of that message. Media outlets including the New York Times, Associated Press, NBC television, ABC radio, and Rush Limbaugh carried the story. PBS sent a crew to Wichita Falls and filmed a documentary on the furor that divided our city. I was fervently denounced by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), People for the American Way (PFAW), the American Library Association (ALA), and Americans United for Separation of Church and State (which later threatened our church&#x2019;s tax-exempt status). The editor of the local newspaper wrote an editorial condemning me for promoting censorship and suggesting that I should be jailed for my act of civil disobedience.<br><br>When we eventually persuaded the city council to pass a compromise regulation giving three hundred adults the right to request that a book deemed offensive be moved from the children&#x2019;s area to the adult section of the library, the ACLU filed suit in federal court to overturn the council&#x2019;s action. According to some legal experts, the ACLU won that challenge, not because the regulation itself was unconstitutional, but because the council&#x2019;s actions were influenced by people of faith.<br><br>But what surprised me most during that two-year ordeal was the reaction of many Christians to our church&#x2019;s stand against homosexuality. One prominent minister of a large denominational church in our community stood in his pulpit one Sunday during the furor and said that he was &#x201c;not called upon to judge, but to tell others about love.&#x201d; A letter to the editor of the Times Record News several days later praised the open-minded pastor:<br><br>Hurray for Dr. _________.... None of us are here to judge and those who choose to actively seek to influence others should do so in a positive manner. We have enough trouble already with hatred and intolerance. Churches have too long been a place where people go to elevate themselves above others, to look down their<br>noses in disdain at the rest of the world. These people have ruined the meaning of the word &#x201c;worship.&#x201d;... Pastors such as Jeffress who have such hatred in their hearts toward any group or individual should be immediately dismissed from any position of influence.... I urge the congregation of First Baptist Church to replace Jeffress with a kinder, more compassionate pastor.3<br><br>Apparently the letter writer&#x2019;s tolerance and compassion extend to everyone except pastors who don&#x2019;t share her viewpoint. Other Christians piled on charges of intolerance, bigotry, hatred, or simply poor judgment in causing a division in our community by taking on a &#x201c;political&#x201d; issue. Most alarmingly, when these Christians were reminded of the biblical teaching on homosexuality, common replies included:<br><br>� &#x201c;Those prohibitions were unique to the culture then, but they don&#x2019;t apply today.&#x201d;<br><br>� &#x201c;Science has taught us a lot about homosexuality since the Bible was written.&#x201d;<br><br>� &#x201c;That may be what we believe, but not everyone accepts the Bible.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course, all of those responses beg the same question: Are there absolute truths that apply to all people at all times, regardless of their faith&#x2013;or lack of faith?<br><b>The Rise of Relativism</b><br><br>Recent surveys tell us that the majority of both Christians and non-Christians answer that question with a resounding &#x201c;No!&#x201d; Researcher George Barna already knew that only a minority of both Christians and<br>non-Christians believed in moral absolutes that transcended time and culture. One would think the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, which were almost universally denounced as evil, would increase the<br>number of people believing in moral absolutes. In reality, the opposite occurred. A survey conducted in the aftermath of the attacks revealed that fewer Americans accepted the notion of absolute truth than prior<br>to September 11. By a 3-to-1 margin, adults said that truth is always relative to a person&#x2019;s individual situation. This view was even more prevalent among teenagers&#x2013;only 6 percent believed that there is such a thing as absolute moral truth.4<br><br>But surely the statistics would be different among Christians who would naturally regard the Bible as the source of absolute truth, right? Don&#x2019;t be so sure. Barna&#x2019;s survey revealed that 68 percent of born-again adults and 91 percent of born-again teenagers rejected the concept of absolute truth.5<br><br>Now you can understand why the three incendiary statements mentioned at the beginning of this chapter are guaranteed to illicit such a negative reaction not only from unbelievers but from professing Christians as well. We have bought into the concept of relative truth, a concept that is best explained by the simple dictum &#x201c;Everything is right sometime, and nothing is right every time.&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s no wonder, Barna notes, that substantial numbers of Christians believe that activities such as homosexuality, cohabitation, and pornography are permissible in some circumstances. &#x201c;Without some firm and compelling basis for suggesting that such acts are inappropriate, people are left with philosophies such as &#x2018;if it feels good, do it.&#x2019; &#x201d;6 Or as another writer says, &#x201c;Being good is now defined as feeling good.&#x201d;<br><br>But the fallout from the wholesale rejection of absolute truth (which, as we will see later, is really just a replacement of one set of absolutes for another) is not confined to morality. The all-out war against absolute truth in favor of relative truth explains why people bristle when someone says, &#x201c;Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven,&#x201d; &#x201c;America is a Christian nation,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Abortion is murder.&#x201d; The greatest sin in our culture today is to claim to be right about anything. Author Allan Bloom, in his book The Closing of the American Mind, writes,<br><br>The study of history and of culture teaches that all the world was mad in the past; men always thought they were right, and that led to wars, persecutions, slavery, xenophobia, racism, and chauvinism. The point is not to correct the mistakes and really be right; rather it is not to think you are right at all.7<br><br>So what? you may wonder. While we may sigh and shake our heads over our culture&#x2019;s rejection of absolute truth, what real d...</p><h2>The English Garden (Red Books)</h2><p>Garden design in England was entirely reinvented during the 18th-century. The strictly symmetrical gardens of the French Baroque were replaced by artificial landscapes which soon became almost indistinguishable from natural scenery. What continues to govern our notions of a beautiful landscape, even today, is the ideal image of Nature conceived by 18th-century English landscape gardeners. This journey through the history of the English garden introduces us to twelve of the most important, original and beautiful parks in Britain, all of which can be visited today.

He analyses previous contributions to a Marxist theory of literature from Marx himself to Lukacs, Althusser, and Goldmann, and develops his own approach by outlining a theory of &#39;cultural materialism&#39; which integrates Marxist theories of language with Marxist theories of literature. Williams moves from a review of the growth of the concepts of literature and idealogy to a redefinition of &#39;determinism&#39; and &#39;hegemony&#39;. His incisive discussion of the &#39;social material process&#39; of cultural activity culminates in a re-examination of the problems of alignment and commitment and of the creative practice in individual authors and wider social groups.</p><p>Raymond Williams was formerly Professor of Drama and Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge.

While the Critique of Pure Reason offers the foundation for his theories of knowledge and reality and the manner in which we come to possess ideas about the world, Kant&#39;s Critique of Practical Reason shows how these mental processes are linked - how the mind moves from a formal understanding of reasoning in general to moral reasoning in particular.</p><h2>The Theft of History</h2><p>Professor Jack Goody builds on his own previous work to extend further his highly influential critique of what he sees as the pervasive eurocentric or occidentalist biases of so much western historical writing. Goody also examines the consequent &#39;theft&#39; by the West of the achievements of other cultures in the invention of (notably) democracy, capitalism, individualism, and love. The Theft of History discusses a number of theorists in detail, including Marx, Weber and Norbert Elias, and engages with critical admiration western historians like Fernand Braudel, Moses Finlay and Perry Anderson. Major questions of method are raised, and Goody proposes a new comparative methodology for cross-cultural analysis, one that gives a much more sophisticated basis for assessing divergent historical outcomes, and replaces outmoded simple differences between East and West. The Theft of History will be read by an unusually wide audience of historians, anthropologists and social theorists.</p><p>Jack Goody builds on his own work to extend his influential critique of what he sees as the pervasive eurocentric or occidentalist biases of western historical writing, and the consequent &#39;theft&#39; by the West of the achievements of other cultures in the invention of (notably) democracy, capitalism, individualism, and love.Jack Goody is Emeritus Professor of Social Anthropology in the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of St John&#39;s College.

Born in Spain in 1542, John joined the Carmelite Order when he was twenty-one. Living in a time of great religious controversy, John was kidnapped and imprisoned -- an experience of deep suffering that formed the basis for some of his most beautiful poetry.<br> <br> This volume represents a modernized edition of John's rarely published work, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>, a commentary on his spiritual poetry. The poem recounts John's passage through a dark night of faith on his journey toward complete union with God. Through his lyric poetry and humble wisdom, he has become an encouraging companion for people throughout the centuries who are passing through their own "dark night of the soul."<br> <br> For the Christian faithful, this volume will serve as an essential introduction to one of Christianity's greatest luminaries. For spiritual seekers of all faiths, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i> provides a classic roadmap for the mystical journey.<br></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish"The soul must pass through the dark night of the senses because all the passions it feels for created things are pure darkness in God's eyes," wrote the Spanish mystic Saint John of the Cross in the late 16th century. In Ascent of Mount Carmel: John of the Cross, John discusses the soul's need to pass through spiritual darkness before union with the divine can be possible. In a beautiful text that has been "edited and mildly modernized" by Henry Carrigan Jr., John offers an early treatise on his spiritual poetry, outlining themes that he fleshed out more fully in his more famous later work, Dark Night of the Soul.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ditch the Baggage, Change Your Life: 7 Keys to Lasting Freedom</h2><p>Nancy Alcorn&#x2019;s practical and effective teaching, <i>Ditch the Baggage, Change Your&nbsp;</i><i>Life</i>, shows you how to walk in freedom, no matter what you have been through or what issues you have faced in your past. &nbsp;You can redefine your life and release thoughts, feelings, and habits that have dragged you down. &nbsp;Then you will begin to live life as it is supposed to be lived in Christ.<br><b>Learn seven keys to lasting freedom, including:</b><br>� Committing fully to Christ� Choosing to forgive� Renewing your mind� Breaking generational patterns� Healing life&#x2019;s hurts� Conquering oppression� Learning principles of lifelong success<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>NANCY ALCORN</b> is the president and founder of Mercy Multiplied, a free, faith-based residential facility for troubled young women ages thirteen to twentyeight.

Fr�d�ric Pierucci, former senior executive of one of Alstom's power company subsidiaries, found himself at the heart of this state scandal. His story goes to the very core of how he plotted the key features of the secret economic war that the United States is waging in Europe. And after being silenced for a long time, he has decided, with the help of journalist Matthieu Aron, to reveal all.</p><p>In April 2013, Fr�d�ric Pierucci was arrested in New York by the FBI and accused of bribery. The US authorities imprisoned him for more than two years - including fourteen months in a notorious maximum-security prison. In doing so, they forced Alstom to pay the biggest financial penalty ever imposed by the United States. In the end, Alstom also gave up areas of control to General Electric, its biggest American competitor.</p><p>Fr�d�ric's story unpacks how the United States is using corporate law as an economic weapon against its own allies.

Kaiwar mobilizes Marxism to demonstrate that subaltern studies is marred by orientalism, and that far richer understandings of Europe&#x2019; not to mention colonialism&#x2019;, modernity&#x2019; and difference&#x2019; are possible without a postcolonialism captive to phenomenological-existentialism and post-structuralism.</p><p><b>Vasant Kaiwar</b> (Ph.D. UCLA, 1989), Visiting Associate Professor of History, Duke University; founder-editor, <i>South Asia Bulletin</i> and <i>Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East</i>; and co-editor, <i>Antinomies of Modernity</i> and <i>From Orientalism to Postcolonialism</i>.<br>&#x201c;The great value of this book lies in Kaiwar's exceptional ability to historicize both postcolonial studies and our global present. This stimulating book offers an exceptional insight into the postcolonial Orient and Europe alike, showing how a critique of Eurocentrism is not sufficient without considering global capitalism. With theoretical sophistication and political passion, Kaiwar makes a compelling case for the still unrealized potentialities of Marxism and modernities that lie before us.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;Massimiliano Tomba</strong>, Dipartimento di Scienze Politiche, Giuridiche e Studi Internazionali, Universit� di Padova<br><br>"An epic elaboration of Kaiwar&#x2019;s arresting thesis about the disturbing symmetries between the postcolonial Left and the Orientalist Right. Despite its calm, erudite tone and impeccable scholarship, The Postcolonial Orient bristles with unexpected reversals and revisions. We close its pages uncomfortably persuaded that Samuel Huntington and subaltern studies share the same two-dimensional thinking about an irrational East and a unique West. A seering and eloquent testament that has found its time." <br><strong>&#x2015;Timothy Brennan</strong>, University of Minnesota<br><br>"A landmark achievement. Measured, articulate and incisive, Kaiwar's book offers both a scorching critique of Subaltern Studies in its 'postcolonial' aspect and a triumphant and very contemporary counter-statement of Marxism as an 'unrenounceable project' within the universe of capitalist modernity. The central argument gathers bite and traction as the book proceeds. A lucid stylist who wears his erudition gracefully, Kaiwar ranges across the disciplines - political economy, sociology, history, philosophy, literary and cultural studies - in a work whose obvious authority is underpinned as much by its solidaristic collegiality as by the precision of its critical intelligence. This is the kind of book by which readers can reset their compasses."<br><strong>&#x2015;Neil Lazarus</strong>, University of Warwick<br><br>"Vasant Kaiwar's book is the long overdue Marxist critique of postcolonial and subaltern studies. But, important and successful as this task is, it is not the only one accomplished by the book, which proceeds to reconstruct what could be a Marxist version of subaltern history - as such, Kaiwar's book is an essential contribution to the revival of Marxist thought.&#x201d; <br><strong>&#x2015;Jean-Jacques Lecercle</strong>, l'Universit� Paris Ouest Nanterre La D�fense<br>[In <em>The Postcolonial Orient</em> Kaiwar demonstrates [that] only a focus on the foundational status of capital...can explain both the proliferation of difference and unevenness across the world and the emergence of capitalism as a system that continues to penetrate every part of the globe, and every aspect of life. Culture and discourse remain crucial, but are best explained in relation to the totality of social relations. Marxism emerges explicitly in <em>The Postcolonial Orient</em> as the &#x2018;unrenounceable&#x2019; project: the key to understanding the links between exploitation and oppression and to forging solidarity across the world. ... The greatest contribution of <em>The Postcolonial Orient</em> is that it combines the work of critiquing postcolonial theory with that of building better understandings of history and culture in the colonised and postcolonial world....By historicising postcolonial theory and also offering an alternative, understanding of colonialism, capitalism, modernity and culture, Kaiwar&#x2019;s book gives us the breadth and depth of field we need to understand the complex workings of capitalism with colonialism, ideology, and culture. <br><strong>&#x2015;Pranav Jani, Ohio State University, author of <em>Decentering Rushdie: Cosmopolitanism and the Indian Novel in English</em></strong><br><br> The great value of this book lies in Kaiwar's exceptional ability to historicize both postcolonial studies and our global present. This stimulating book offers an exceptional insight into the postcolonial Orient and Europe alike, showing how a critique of Eurocentrism is not sufficient without considering global capitalism. With theoretical sophistication and political passion, Kaiwar makes a compelling case for the still unrealized potentialities of Marxism and modernities that lie before us.&#x201d;<br><b> Massimiliano Tomba</b>, Dipartimento di Scienze Politiche, Giuridiche e Studi Internazionali, Universit� di Padova<br><br>"An epic elaboration of Kaiwar&#x2019;s arresting thesis about the disturbing symmetries between the postcolonial Left and the Orientalist Right. Despite its calm, erudite tone and impeccable scholarship, The Postcolonial Orient bristles with unexpected reversals and revisions. We close its pages uncomfortably persuaded that Samuel Huntington and subaltern studies share the same two-dimensional thinking about an irrational East and a unique West. A seering and eloquent testament that has found its time."<br><b> Timothy Brennan</b>, University of Minnesota<br><br>"A landmark achievement. Measured, articulate and incisive, Kaiwar's book offers both a scorching critique of Subaltern Studies in its 'postcolonial' aspect and a triumphant and very contemporary counter-statement of Marxism as an 'unrenounceable project' within the universe of capitalist modernity. The central argument gathers bite and traction as the book proceeds. A lucid stylist who wears his erudition gracefully, Kaiwar ranges across the disciplines - political economy, sociology, history, philosophy, literary and cultural studies - in a work whose obvious authority is underpinned as much by its solidaristic collegiality as by the precision of its critical intelligence. This is the kind of book by which readers can reset their compasses."<br><b> Neil Lazarus</b>, University of Warwick<br><br>"Vasant Kaiwar's book is the long overdue Marxist critique of postcolonial and subaltern studies. But, important and successful as this task is, it is not the only one accomplished by the book, which proceeds to reconstruct what could be a Marxist version of subaltern history - as such, Kaiwar's book is an essential contribution to the revival of Marxist thought.&#x201d;<br><b> Jean-Jacques Lecercle</b>, l'Universit� Paris Ouest Nanterre La D�fense</p><h2>Barchester Towers (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics)</h2><p>Dust jacket worn.

Not well known in the West, the battles of Isonzo were nevertheless ferocious, and compiled a record of bloodletting that totaled over 1.75 million for both sides. In sharp contrast to claims that neither the Italian nor the Austrian armies were viable fighting forces, Schindler aims to bring the terrible sacrifices endured by both armies back to their rightful place in the history of 20th century Europe. The Habsburg Empire, he contends, lost the war for military and economic reasons rather than for political or ethnic ones.</p><p></p><p>Schindler's account includes references to remarkable personalities such as Mussolini; Tito; Hemingway; Rommel, and the great maestro Toscanini. This Alpine war had profound historical consequences that included the creation of the Yugoslav state, the problem of a rump Austrian state looking to Germany for leadership, and the traumatic effects on a generation of young Italian men who swelled the ranks of the fascists. After nearly a century, Isonzo can assume its proper place in the ranks of the tragic Great War clashes, alongside Verdun, the Somme, and Passchendaele.</p></p><p><p>The first complete account of the epic struggle between the Austrian and Italian armies along the Isonzo River during the First World War.</p><p><b>John R.

It is organized around psychiatric "syndromes" rather than <i>DSM</i> diagnoses, so it will remain current even after the publication of the <i>DSM-5</i>. The book provides clear and relevant treatment options in the form of decision trees with additional explanatory narratives. These decision trees enable practitioners to distinguish "normal" patients from those who require more customized therapeutic interventions. This holistic text integrates neurobiology, theory, and research evidence related to psychotherapy, psychopharmacology, and complementary and alternative medicine interventions. While providing comprehensive information on theory and practice, it simplifies complex aspects of treatment with clarity and provides the depth of content appropriate to support sound clinical reasoning required in advanced practice. </p> <p>The book responds to the current backlash against overmedication in psychiatry. It also fulfills the upcoming requirements by APNA and ISPN that advanced practice psychiatric nurses must have skills in psychotherapy.

Through its three generations of existence civil war and familial passions were to be both the source of sustenance and ultimate destruction of the Empire. This retelling of the drama of the era includes: the murder of Thomas Beckett, advisor to Henry II and later bishop of Canterbury; the wars of rebellion of Richard the Lionheart and John Lackland&nbsp; against their father Henry II; the crusades of Richard the Lionheart culminating in his capture; and the eventual crumbling of the empire under the reign of Henry III at the hands of his father&#x2019;s widow and Louis VIII.&nbsp;</p> <p>Aurell&#x2019;s superb knowledge of the complex sources for the period uncovers a world where sophisticated decision making and modern political manoeuvring: a world where political spin and propaganda were deliberately employed by Plantagenet Kings in ideological warfare against their rivals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></p><p><p> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Professor Crouch has done an admirable service for non-Francophone historians by translating Martin Aurell's <i>L'Empire des Plantagenet</i>.&nbsp; It is a fascinating thematic study of Angevin kingship and government, taking a very different approach from most English language works.&nbsp; The publishers too must be congratulated for commissioning the translation.&#x201d; <i>John Hudson, St. Andrew's University</i> </p> <p>Within the space of a century, the Plantagenet dynasty secured and then lost much of Western Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152, young Henry II, claimant to the throne of England, found himself the head of a vast territory. Stretching from Scotland in the north to the Pyrenees in the south and from Ireland in the west eastwards to Limousin, the Plantagenet Empire was founded and maintained through a combination of war and family ties. In order to maintain control, Henry II created a bureaucratic state run by intellectuals, skilled in the art of political spin and propaganda, and deliberately employed to wage ideological warfare against his Capetian rivals. </p> <p>In this new translation by David Crouch, Martin Aurell revives the passion and politics, revolts and reversals of the&nbsp;Plantagenet Empire. Using the complex sources for the period,&nbsp;the author&nbsp;uncovers an intricate web of sophisticated decision making and political manoeuvring,&nbsp;and brings to life the world of the 12th-century political consultants and gurus: men capable of thinking in the sort of geo-political terms hitherto unimagined in the earlier medieval period.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the retelling of the drama, Aurell recounts the murder of Thomas Beckett, advisor to Henry II and later bishop of Canterbury; the implacable hatred of Richard the Lionheart and John Lackland towards their father Henry II; the crusades of Richard the Lionheart; and the eventual crumbling of the empire under Henry III.</p> <p>A must read for any serious medievalist and all university students studying the twelfth and thirteenth century, David Crouch&#x2019;s superb translation now allows an English-speaking audience access to this fascinating study of power at its source. </p> <p> <b>Martin Aurell </b>is Professor of Medieval History at the Universityof Poitiers.&nbsp; He is the author of several books, including <i>Actes de la Famille Porcelet d&#x2019;Arles, 972-1320 </i>(2001) and, with Jean-Paul Boyer and Noel Coulet, <i>La </i> <i>Provence</i> <i>au Moyen Age </i>(2005).&nbsp; </p> <p> <b>David Crouch </b>is Professor of Medieval History at the Universityof Hull.&nbsp; His publications include <i>William Marshal </i>(2002) and <i>The Birth of Nobility: Constructing Aristocracy in </i> <i>England</i> <i>and </i> <i>France</i> <i>, 950-1350 </i>(2005).</p><p>"Professor Crouch has done an admirable service for non-Francophone historians by translating Martin Aurell's L'Empire des Plantagenet.&nbsp; It is a fascinating thematic study of Angevin kingship and government, taking a very different approach from most English language works.&nbsp; The publishers too must be congratulated for commissioning the translation."</p> <p> <i>John Hudson, St. Andrew's University</i> </p> <p>"<i>The Plantagenet Empire</i> is a valuable addtion to the literature that introduces a welcome French perspective to Anglophone readers."<br> <i>Michael Evans, Central Michigan University</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Stretching For Dummies</h2><p>Did you long ago learn to fear and dread stretching because of overbearing P.E. teachers who forced you to touch your toes?

The theory of signals and systems is one of those fundamentals, and it will be the foundation of much research and development in engineering for years to come. Not only engineers will need to know about signals and systems&#x2014;to some degree everybody will. The pervasiveness of computers, cell phones, digital recording, and digital communications will require it.</p> <p>Learning as well as teaching signals and systems is complicated by the combination of mathematical abstraction and concrete engineering applications. Mathematical sophistication and maturity in engineering are needed. Thus, a course in signals and systems needs to be designed to nurture the students&#x2019; interest in applications, but also to make them appreciate the significance of the mathematical tools. In writing this textbook, as in teaching this material for many years, the author has found it practical to follow Einstein&#x2019;s recommendation that &#x201c;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler,&#x201d; and Melzak&#x2019;s [47] dictum that &#x201c;It is downright sinful to teach the abstract before the concrete.&#x201d; The aim of this textbook is to serve the students&#x2019; needs in learning signals and systems theory as well as to facilitate the teaching of the material for faculty by proposing an approach that the author has found effective in his own teaching.</p> <p>We consider the use of MATLAB, an essential tool in the practice of engineering, of great significance in the learning process.

And every time he got there he dropped a suggestion in the suggestion box. It was always the same suggestion: "Why not make next year's refrigerator in the shape of a woman?" Then there would be a sketch of a refrigerator shaped like a woman, with arrows showing where the vegetable crisper and the butter conditioner and the ice cubes and all would go.<br><br>George called it the Food-O-Mama. Everybody thought the Food-O-Mama was an extra-good joke because George was out on the road all year long, dancing and talking and singing with a refrigerator shaped like a refrigerator. Its name was Jenny. George had designed and built Jenny back when he'd been a real comer in the GHA Research Laboratory.<br><br>George might as well have been married to Jenny. He lived with her in the back of a moving van that was mostly filled with her electronic brains. He had a cot and a hot plate and a three-legged stool and a table and a locker in the back of the van. And he had a doormat he put on the bare ground outside when he parked the van somewhere for the night. "Jenny and George," it said. It glowed in the dark.<br><br>Jenny and George went from appliance dealer to appliance dealer all over the United States and Canada. They would dance and sing and crack jokes until they'd collected a good crowd in a store. Then they would make a strong sales pitch for all the GHA appliances standing around doing nothing.<br><br>Jenny and George had been at it since 1934. George was sixty-four years old when I got out of college and joined the company. When I heard about George's big paycheck and his free way of life and the way he made people laugh and buy appliances, why I guessed he was the happiest man in the company.<br><br>But I never got to see Jenny and George until I got transferred out to the Indianapolis offices. One morning out there we got a telegram saying Jenny and George were in our neck of the woods somewhere--and would we please find them and tell George his ex-wife was very sick? She wasn't expected to live. She wanted to see him.<br><br>I was very surprised to hear he'd had a wife. But some of the older people in the office knew about her. George had only lived with her for six months--and then he'd hit the road with Jenny. His ex-wife's name was Nancy. Nancy had turned right around and married his best friend.<br>I got the job of tracking Jenny and George down. The company never knew exactly where they were. George made his own schedule. The company gave him his head. They just kept rough track of him by his expense accounts and by rave letters they'd get from distributors and dealers.<br><br>And almost every rave letter told about some new stunt that Jenny'd done, that Jenny'd never been able to do before. George couldn't leave her alone. He tinkered with her every spare minute, as though his life depended on making Jenny as human as possible.<br>I called our distributor for central Indiana, Hal Flourish. I asked him if he knew where Jenny and George were. He laughed to beat the band and said he sure did. Jenny and George were right in Indianapolis, he said. They were out at the Hoosier Appliance Mart. He told me Jenny and George had stopped early morning traffic by taking a walk down North Meridian Street.<br><br>"She had on a new hat and a corsage and a yellow dress," he said. "And George was all dolled up in his soup and fish and yellow spats and a cane. You would of died. And you know how he's got her fixed up now, so's he knows when her battery's running down?"<br><br>"Nossir," I said.<br><br>"She yawns," he said, "and her eyelids get all droopy."<br>Jenny and George were starting their first show of the day when I got out to the Hoosier Appliance Mart. It was a swell morning. George was on the sidewalk in the sunshine, leaning on the fender of the moving van that had Jenny's brains in it. He and Jenny were singing a duet. They were singing the "Indian Love Call." They were pretty good. George would sing, "I'll be calling you-hoo," in a gravel baritone. Then Jenny would answer back from the doorway of the Mart in a thin, girlish soprano.<br><br>Sully Harris, who owned the Mart, was standing by Jenny with one arm draped over her. He was smoking a cigar and counting the house.<br><br>George had on the dress suit and yellow spats Hal Flourish had laughed so hard about. George's coattails dragged on the ground. His white vest was buttoned down around his knees. His shirt bosom was rolled up under his chin like a window blind. And he had on trick shoes that looked like bare feet the size of canoe paddles. The toenails were painted fire-engine red.<br><br>But Hal Flourish is the kind of man who thinks anything that's supposed to be funny is funny. George wasn't funny if you looked at him closely. And I had to look at him closely because I wasn't there for a good time. I was bringing him sad news. I looked at him closely, and I saw a small man getting on in years and all alone in this vale of tears. I saw a small man with a big nose and brown eyes that were just sick about something.<br><br>But most people in the crowd thought he was a howl. Just here and there you'd see a few people who saw what I saw. Their smiles weren't making fun of George. Their smiles were kind of queer and sweet. Their smiles mostly seemed to ask how Jenny worked.<br>Jenny was radio-controlled, and the controls were in those trick shoes of George's--under his toes. He would punch buttons with his toes, and the shoes would send out signals to Jenny's brains in the moving van. Then the brains would signal Jenny what to do. There weren't any wires between Jenny and George and the van.<br><br>It was hard to believe George had anything to do with what Jenny was up to. He had a little pink earphone in his ear, so he could hear everything anybody said to Jenny, even when she was a hundred feet away. And he had little rearview mirrors on the frames of his glasses, so he could turn his back to her and still see everything she did.<br><br>When they stopped singing, Jenny picked me out to kid around with. "Hello, tall, dark, and handsome," she said to me. "Did the old icebox drive you out of the house?" She had a sponge rubber face at the top of the door, with springs embedded in it and a loudspeaker behind it. Her face was so real, I almost had to believe there was a beautiful woman inside the refrigerator--with her face stuck through a hole in the door.<br><br>I kidded her back. "Look, Mrs. Frankenstein," I said to her, "why don't you go off in a corner somewhere and make some ice cubes? I want to have a private talk with your boss."<br><br>Her face turned from pink to white. Her lips trembled. Then her lips pulled down and dragged her whole face out of shape. She shut her eyes so she wouldn't have to look at such a terrible person. And then, as God is my judge, she squeezed out two fat tears. They ran down her cheeks, then down her white enamelled front to the floor.<br><br>I smiled and winked at George to let him know how slick I thought his act was, and that I really did want to see him.<br><br>He didn't smile back. He didn't like me for talking to Jenny that way. You would have thought I'd spit in the eye of his mother or sister or something.<br>A kid about ten years old came up to George and said, "Hey, Mister, I bet I know how she works. You got a midget in there."<br><br>"You're the first one who ever guessed," George said. "Now that everybody knows, I might as well let the midget out." He motioned for Jenny to come out on the sidewalk with him.<br><br>I expected her to waddle and clank like a tractor, because she weighed seven hundred pounds. But she had a light step to go with that beautiful face of hers. I never saw such a case of mind over matter. I forgot all about the refrigerator. All I saw was her.<br><br>She sidled up to George. "What is it, Sweetheart?" she said.<br><br>"The jig is up," George said. "This bright boy knows you're a midget inside. Might as well come on out and get some fresh air and meet the nice people." He hesitated just long enough and looked just glum enough to make the people think maybe they were really going to see a midget.<br><br>And then there was a whirr and a click, and Jenny's door swung open. There wasn't anything inside but cold air, stainless steel, porcelain, and a glass of orange juice. It was a shock to everybody--all that beauty and personality on the outside, and all that cold nothing on the inside.<br><br>George took a sip from the glass of orange juice, put it back in Jenny and closed her door.<br><br>"I'm certainly glad to see you taking care of yourself for a change," Jenny said. You could tell she was crazy about him, and that he broke her heart about half the time. "Honestly," she said to the crowd, "the poor man should be dead of scurvy and rickets by now, the way he eats."<br><br>An audience is the nuttiest thing there is, if you ever stop to think about it. Here George had proved there wasn't anything inside Jenny, and here the crowd was, twenty seconds later, treating her like a real human being again. The women were shaking their heads to let Jenny know they knew what a trial it was to get a man to take care of himself. And the men were giving George secret looks to let him know they knew what a good pain it was to have a woman always treating you like a baby.<br><br>The only person who wasn't going along with the act, who wasn't being a boob for the pleasure of it, was the kid who'd guessed there was a midget inside. He was sore about being wrong, and his big ambition was to bust up the act with truth--Truth with a capital T. He'll grow up to be a scientist someday. "All right," the kid said, "if there isn't a midget in there, then I know exactly how it works."<br><br>"How, honey?" said Jenny. She was all ears for whatever bright little thing this kid was going to say. She really burned him up.<br><br>"Radio controls!" the kid said.<br><br>"Oooooo!" said Jenny. She was thrilled. "That would be a grand way to do it!"<br><br>The kid turned purple. "You can joke around all you want," he said, "but that's the answer and you know it." He challenged George. "What's your explanation?" he said.<br><br>"Three thousand years ago," said George, "the sultan of Alla-Bakar fell in love with the wisest, most affectionate, most beautiful woman who ever lived. She was Jenny, a slave girl.<br><br>"The old sultan knew there would be constant bloodshed in his kingdom," said George, "because men who saw Jenny always went mad for her love. So the old sultan had his court magician take Jenny's spirit out of her body and put it in a bottle. This he locked up in his treasury.<br><br>"In 1933," said George, "Lionel O. Heartline, president of the General Household Appliances Company, bought a curious bottle while on a business trip to fabled Baghdad. He brought it home, opened it, and out came the spirit of Jenny--three thousand years old. I was working in the Research Laboratory of GH at the time, and Mr. Heartline asked me what I could provide in the way of a new body for Jenny. So I rigged the shell of a refrigerator with a face, a voice, and feet--and with spirit controls, which work on Jenny's willpower alone."<br><br>It was such a silly story, I forgot it as soon as I'd chuckled at it. It took me weeks to realize that George wasn't just hamming it up when he told the story from his heart. He was getting as close to the truth about Jenny as he ever dared get. He was getting close to it with poetry.<br><br>"And, hey presto!--here she is," said George.<br><br>"Baloney!" the scientific kid yelled. But the audience wasn't with him, never would be.<br><br>Jenny let out a big sigh, thinking about those three thousand years in a bottle. "Well," she said, "that part of my life's all over now. No use crying over spilt milk. On with the show."<br><br>She slunk into the Mart, and everybody but George and I toddled right in behind her.<br><br>George, still controlling her with his toes, ducked into the cab of the moving van. I followed him and stuck my head in the window. There he was, the top of his trick shoes rippling while his toes made Jenny talk a blue streak in the Mart. At nine o'clock on a sunshiny morning he was taking a big drink from a bottle of booze.<br>When his eyes stopped watering and his throat stopped stinging he said to me, "What you looking at me that way for, Sonny Jim? Didn't you see me drink my orange juice first like a good boy? It isn't as though I was drinking before breakfast."<br><br>"Excuse me," I said. I got away from the truck to give him time to pull himself together, and to give me time, too.<br><br>"When I saw that beautiful GHA refrigerator in the Research Laboratory," Jenny was saying in the Mart, "I said to George, 'That's the flawless white body for me.'" She glanced at me and then at George, and she shut up and her party smile went away for a couple of seconds. Then she cleared her throat and went on. "Where was I?" she said.<br><br>George wasn't about to get out of the cab. He was staring through the windshield now at something very depressing five thousand miles away. He was ready to spend the whole day like that.<br><br>Jenny finally ran out of small talk, and she came to the door and called him. "Honey," she called, "are you coming in pretty soon?"<br><br>"Keep your shirt on," George said. He didn't look at her.<br><br>"Is--is everything all right?" she said.<br><br>"Grand," George said, still staring through the windshield. "Just grand."</p><h2>Surgery PreTest Self-Assessment and Review, Thirteenth Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The closest you can get to seeing the USMLE Step 2 CK without actually taking it</b></p><p><i>Surgery: PreTest Self-Assessment &amp; Review</i> is the perfect way to assess your knowledge of surgery for the USMLE Step 2 CK and shelf exams.

Throughout their evolutionary history, humans have affected the natural environment, sometimes with a promise of sustainable balance, but also in a destructive manner. This book investigates the ways in which environmental changes, often the result of human actions, have caused historical trends in human societies. This process has happened in every historical period and in every part of the inhabited earth. </p> <p></p> <p>The book is organized into ten chapters. The main chapters follow a chronological path through the history of mankind, in relationship to ecosystems around the world. The first explains what environmental history is, and argues for its importance in understanding the present state of the world's ecological problems. Chapters two through eight form the core of the historical analysis, each concentrating on a major period of human history (pre-civilized, early civilizations, classical, medieval, early modern, early and later twentieth century, and contemporary) that has been characterized by large-scale changes in the relationship between human societies and the biosphere, and each gives several case studies that illustrate significant patterns occurring at that time. The chapters covering contemporary times discuss the physical impacts of the huge growth in population and technology, and the human responses to these problems. Our moral obligations to nature and how we can achieve a sustainable balance between technology and the environment are also considered. This revised second edition takes account of new research and the course of history containing new sections on global warming, the response of New Orleans to the hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the experience of the Dutch people in protecting their low-lying lands against the encroachments of rivers, lakes, and the North Sea. New material is also offered on the Pacific Islands, including the famous case of Easter Island.</p> <p></p> <p>This is an original work that reaches further than other environmental histories. Rather than looking at humans and the environment as separate entities, this book places humans within the community of life. The relationship between environmental thought and actions, and their evolution, is discussed throughout. Little environmental or historical knowledge is assumed from the reader in this introduction to environmental history. We cannot reach a useful understanding of modern environmental problems without the aid of perspective provided by environmental history, with its illustrations of the ways in which past decisions helped or hindered the interaction between nature and culture. This book will be influential and timely to all interested in or researching the world in which we live.</p></p><p><p>J.

It covers the implementation of a DBMS, notably storage structure, query processing, and transaction management. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Preface <p> This book was designed for CS245, the second course in the database sequence at Stanford. Here, the first database course, CS145, covers database design and programming, for which the book A First Course in Database Systems by Jeff Ullman and Jennifer Widom, Prentice-Hall, 1997, was written. The CS245 course then covers implementation of a DBMS, notably storage structures, query processing, and transaction management. Use of the Book </p><p> We're on a quarter system at Stanford, so the principal course using this book - CS245 - is only ten weeks long. In the Winter of 1999, Hector Garcia-Molina used a "beta" version of this book, and covered the following parts: Sections 2.1-2.4, all of Chapters 3 and 4, Sections 5.1 and 5.2, Sections 6.1--6.7, Sections 7.1-7.4, all of Chapter 8, Chapter 9 except for Section 9.8, Sections 10.1-10.3, Section 11.1, and Section 11.5. </p><p> The balance of Chapters 6 and 7 (query optimization) is covered in an advanced course, CS346, where students implement their own DBMS. Other portions of the book that are not covered in CS245 may appear in another advanced course, CS347, which talks about distributed databases and advanced transaction processing. </p><p> Schools that are on the semester system have the opportunity to combine the use of this book with its predecessor: A First Course in Database Systems. We recommend using that book in the first semester, coupled with a database-application programming project. The second semester could cover most or all of the content of this book. An advantage to splitting the study of databases into two courses is that students not planning to specialize in DBMS construction can take only the first course and be able to use databases in whatever branch of Computer Science they enter. Prerequisites </p><p> The course on which the book is based is rarely taken before the senior year, so we expect the reader to have a fairly broad background in the traditional areas of Computer Science. We assume that the reader has learned something about database programming, especially SQL. It is helpful to know about relational algebra and to have some familiarity with basic data structures. Likewise, some knowledge of file systems and operating systems is useful. Exercises </p><p> The book contains extensive exercises, with some for almost every section. We indicate harder exercises or parts of exercises with an exclamation point. The hardest exercises have a double exclamation point. </p><p> Some of the exercises or parts are marked with a star. For these exercises, we shall endeavor to maintain solutions accessible through the book's Web page. These solutions are publicly available and should be used for self-testing. Note that in a few cases, one exercise B asks for modification or adaptation of your solution to another exercise A. If certain parts of A have Web-published solutions, then you should expect the corresponding parts of B to have solutions as well.We hope to make available the notes for each offering of CS245 and relevant portions of other database courses, as we teach them, including homeworks, exams, and solutions.

Hillary Clinton had charged this fiercely competitive, meticulously organized chef with bringing 'what's best about American food, wine, and entertaining to the White House.' His sophisticated contemporary food was generally considered some of the best ever served there."<br>--Marian Burros, <i>New York Times</i><p><b>White House Chef</b></p><p>Join Walter Scheib as he serves up a taste--in stories and recipes--of his eleven years as White House chef under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.</p><p>Scheib takes readers along on his whirlwind adventure, from his challenging audition process right up until his controversial departure. He describes his approach to meals ranging from the intimate (rooftop parties and surprise birthday celebrations for the Clintons; Tex-Mex brunches for the Bushes) to his creative approach to bringing contemporary American cuisine to the "people's house" (including innovative ways to serve state dinners for up to seven hundred people and picnics and holiday menus for several thousand guests).</p><p>Scheib goes beyond the kitchen and his job as chef. He shares what it is like to be part of President Clinton's motorcade (the "security bubble") and inside the White House during 9/11, revealing how he first evacuates his staff and then comes back to fix meals for hundreds of hungry security and rescue personnel. Staying cool under pressure also helps Scheib in other aspects of his job, such as withstanding the often-changing "temperature" of the White House and satisfying the culinary sensibilities of two very different first families.</p></p><p>Hired by First Lady Hillary Clinton to become White House chef in 1994, Walter Scheib faced a daunting challenge&#x2014;to take an outdated kitchen focused on traditional French cooking and make it a modern showcase for restaurant-quality American food, featuring the best seasonal ingredients and vibrant contemporary flavors. Scheib seized the opportunity and the world noticed. Menus and even some culinary controversies were reflected in major publications such as the New York Times and Newsweek, and were the subject of political cartoons like Doonesbury. Scheib's meals were praised by high-profile epicures including Julia Child and French prime minister Jacques Chirac. As more was accomplished, more was expected, and Scheib stepped up, serving thousands of innovative meals during the Clinton years and through the first term of the Bush administration.<p></p><p>In this fascinating memoir, Scheib shares a personal, kitchen-eye view of life in the White House during his eleven years "at the stove" under two very different administrations. He offers an intimate portrait of the Clinton White House&#x2014;and captures how the arrival of the Bushes changed everything. You'll read about:</p><ul> <li>Preparations for state dinners honoring many world leaders, including the dinner for Nelson Mandela, one of the most anticipated White House events during President Clinton's time in office</li> <li>Scheib's twenty-nine-hour "day" (without sleep) orchestrating the White House Millennial New Year's Eve celebrations</li> <li>The Clintons' mandate for authentic "local" dishes at the G8 Summit meal in Colorado, resulting in a meal featuring American buffalo, cowboy rollups, and rattlesnake</li> <li>President Bush's tee ball games on the White House lawn and the president's insistence that the hot dogs must be steamed, never grilled</li></ul><p>Scheib also captures the more personal side of his job&#x2014;serving as private chef to the first family. You'll read about Scheib:</p><ul> <li>Cheering up Mrs. Clinton with an off-the-menu dish of Sizzling Fajitas when it seems she's having a challenging day</li> <li>Serving President Clinton a big Porterhouse Steak with B�arnaise Sauce and Onion Rings when his wife is out of town</li> <li>Teaching Chelsea Clinton how to cook before she goes away to college</li> <li>Bantering with President Bush&#x2014;who calls him "Cookie"&#x2014;almost daily about "what's for lunch"</li></ul><p>Full of revealing anecdotes, photographs, menus, and special White House recipes&#x2014;from the Pecan-Crusted Lamb with Red-Curried Sweet Potatoes that helped Scheib ace his job audition to the Vodka-Marinated Salmon and Kasha Pilaf prepared for the ever-merrier Russian president Boris Yeltsin to Laura Bush's Roasted Beet Salad at lunches&#x2014;White House Chef is a treat for everyone who loves food, politics, or both.</p>ANDREW FRIEDMAN is the coauthor of a number of cookbooks, including the award-winning <i>Alfred Portale's Gotham Bar and Grill Cookbook, Da Silvano Cookbook, </i>and Tom Valenti's <i>Welcome to My Kitchen.</i> He lives in New York City with his family.</p><h2>Swarming and Its Control and Prevention</h2><p>Swarming and Its Control and Prevention</p><p></p><h2>The Art and Science of Analog Circuit Design (Edn Series for Design Engineers)</h2><p>* Visualizing the operation of analog circuits * Troubleshooting for optimum circuit performance * Producing a saleable product * Career guidance for engineers<br> In this companion text to Analog Circuit Design: Art, Science, and Personalities, seventeen contributors present more tutorial, historical, and editorial viewpoints on subjects related to analog circuit design.

Moroye, Assistant Professor of Curriculum and Supervision Published On: 2008-11-20</p><h2>Mansfield Park (Konemann Classics)</h2><p>HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics. &#39;I pay very little regard!to what any young person says on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for it, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.&#39; Humble and lowly, a young Fanny Price goes to live with her wealthy Aunt and Uncle at their grand house, Mansfield Park. Growing up with her privileged and spoilt cousins, the Bertrams, she lives in the shadows of their glamorous lives, but manages to find an ally in her cousin, Edmund. When Henry and Mary Crawford come to visit, the house is thrown into disarray as romance flourishes between the young people, leading Fanny to finally confront the extent of her true feelings for Edmund.</p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Dimensions of a New Identity</h2><p><p><strong>The two lectures presented in this important volume were delivered by Erik H. Erikson at the second annual Jefferson Lectures in the Humanities, sponsored by The National Endowment for the Humanitites.</strong></p> In the first lecture, entitled "The Founders: Jeffersonion Action and Faith," Erikson uses selected themes from Jefferson's life to illustrate some principles of psychohistory. In the second lecture, "The Inheritors: Modern Insight and Foresight," Erikson applied his main concepts to the problems of ongoing history. The title of the lectures contains one such concept. "New identity" is the result of radical historical change and is here meant to characterize the emerging American identity as first embodied in such men as Jefferson.<br><br> Erikson first explores certain themes in his examination of the emerging American identity during Jefferson's time. He then attempts to relate the Jeffersonian themes to contemporary problems of repression and suppression, of moralistic vindication, and true liberation by insight.<br><br> Finally, Erikson maintains that now that children will be born by the privileged choice of parental persons, an adult environment fitting the living and the to-be-living becomes an ethical necessity.<br><br> There is no question that this work ranks among Erikson's most challenging and seminal books.</p><p>A winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, Erik H. Erikson was renowned worldwide as teacher, clinician, and theorist in the field of psychoanalysis and human development.</p><h2>Taking Sides: Clashing Views in Human Sexuality</h2><p>The <strong>Taking Sides Collection</strong> on McGraw-Hill Create&#x2122; includes current controversial issues in a debate-style format designed to stimulate student interest and develop critical thinking skills.

Typeset and bound by Virginia, with illustrations by Dora Carrington, 134 copies were printed by Leonard using a small handpress installed in the dining room at Hogarth House. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of "Publication No. 1,"&nbsp;this new edition of <i>Two Stories</i> takes the original text of Virginia&#x2019;s story, "The Mark on the Wall"&nbsp;(with illustrations by Dora Carrington), and pairs it with a new story, "St Brides Bay," by Mark Haddon, a lifelong reader of Virginia Woolf.<i> Two Stories</i> also includes a portrait of Virginia Woolf by Mark Haddon, and a short introduction from the publisher about the founding of the Press.</p></p><p><p><b>Virginia Woolf </b>(1882&#x2013;1941) was one of the most influential writers of the 20th century.

Anyone who started a business, marketed a new invention, ran for office, formed an association, or wrote for publication was helping to fashion the world's first liberal society. These are the people we encounter in <i>Inheriting the Revolution</i>, a vibrant tapestry of the lives, callings, decisions, desires, and reflections of those Americans who turned the new abstractions of democracy, the nation, and free enterprise into contested realities.</p><p>Through data gathered on thousands of people, as well as hundreds of memoirs and autobiographies, Joyce Appleby tells myriad intersecting stories of how Americans born between 1776 and 1830 reinvented themselves and their society in politics, economics, reform, religion, and culture. They also had to grapple with the new distinction of free and slave labor, with all its divisive social entailments; the rout of Enlightenment rationality by the warm passions of religious awakening; the explosion of small business opportunities for young people eager to break out of their parents' colonial cocoon. Few in the nation escaped the transforming intrusiveness of these changes. Working these experiences into a vivid picture of American cultural renovation, Appleby crafts an extraordinary--and deeply affecting--account of how the first generation established its own culture, its own nation, its own identity.</p><br><br><p>The passage of social responsibility from one generation to another is always a fascinating interplay of the inherited and the novel; this book shows how, in the early nineteenth century, the very idea of generations resonated with new meaning in the United States.</p></p><p>Joyce Appleby was Professor of History, Emerita, at the University of California, Los Angeles.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/APPINH_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>The Language of Flowers Symbols and Myths (Prestel Minis)</h2><p>Attractive, affordable, and adorable, these miniature versions of popular Prestel titles are the perfect gifts. <p>They&#x2019;re packed with color, yet small enough to fit into a pocket or purse.

This engaging descriptive text is followed by 36 of the most beautiful flower depictions of the Renaissance and Baroque. Individual sections cover in detail each flower, setting forth in short, vivid, texts its history, significance, and use."Say it with Flowers," is a florist's clich&#x201a;, but few realize how much flowers can convey. Marina Heilmeyer's The Language of Flowers: Symbols and Myths provides an engaging translation of their significance across centuries and cultures. Writing with journalist Susan Weiss, Heilmeyer, a botanist and art historian, explains the meanings and rituals surrounding 35 different flowers. Readers will learn that for Christians, ever since the Middle Ages, the daffodil has symbolized Christ's resurrection. Violets have an even longer-standing connection to the hereafter, dating back to the myth of Persephone, who was strolling through a meadow of violets when Hades kidnapped her. Rosemary, a symbol of love, was in ancient times burned at altars to appease or thank volatile gods.

What does the forest look like? How do the activities of this forest's plants and animals create a community?<br> Now, in <em>A Magic Web</em>, photographer Christian Ziegler and ecologist Egbert Leigh invite readers to enter the marvelous world of Barro Colorado Island. This book provides a unique combination of the spectacular photography of a picture-book and clear, authoritative text written by an active scientist who has spent half a lifetime trying to understand tropical forests. The photographs provide views of the forest and its spectacular diversity of inhabitants, and show many of the activities that give the forest its character and lend structure to its community. Drawing on decades of work on Barro Colorado Island, Egbert Leigh explains how the forest works. The photographs and text reveal the many ways its plants and animals compete with but also depend on each other: the contrasts between solitary cats and intricately organized armies of ants; the different ways plants struggle for a place in the sun, and the ways these plants attract, or domesticate, animals to pollinate their flowers. Finally, the authors show why this, and by implication all other, tropical forests matter to the people who live near them and to the world at large, what we can learn from these forests, and how they differ from temperate-zone forests. <br> Full of gorgeous full-color photographs accompanied by clear and accessible text, <em>A Magic Web</em> is a must for anyone planning to visit a tropical forest, and for all those who only wish they could.</p><p><br><strong>Christian Ziegler</strong> is a free-lance nature and wildlife photographer, now associated with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, more of whose work can be viewed at www.naturphoto.de. <br><strong>Egbert Giles Leigh, Jr.</strong> is a Biologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the author of <em>Tropical Forest Ecology</em> (OUP).<br><br>"You will learn more reading this volume than on a personal visit to the tropics. This book is the best summary of the tropical ecosystem and the behavior of its inhabitants. It shows how this system works. Both your sense of beauty and your thirst for understanding will be satisfied abundantly."--Ernst Mayr<p></p><br>"This tour of a lush, forested island in Panama is a mostly successful blend of coffee-table nature book and science narrative on tropical ecology. Photographer Ziegler and ecologist Leigh spent more than a year on Barro Colorado Island trying to capture the essence of what makes the island a priceless jewel, to 'lift the green curtain' on the rainforest. Through words and pictures, the interconnectedness of all living things on the island becomes apparent. Wild nutmeg trees depend on toucans for seed dispersal; herbivorous insects keep the leafy biomass under control; bats, in turn, eat the insects. Each species is intimately involved with the next, and Ziegler offers some amazing close-up shots of these evolutionary partnerships in action.... A wealth of information and images for rainforest enthusiasts."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Tropical forests constitute the greatest challenge in natural history photography today. The potential for stunning images is enormous, but the day-to-day problems are daunting. By focusing his unusual combination of knowledge, perseverance and artistry on one small island in Panama over an extended period of time, Christian Ziegler has confirmed that tropical forests are the richest biome on earth, and the wonders accumulate when you slow yourself down. This is a special collection of images, which belongs on the bookshelves of those who already appreciate their significance and those who need to."--Frans Lanting, author of <em>Jungles</em><p></p><br>"Christian Ziegler's stunning photographs of the plants and animals of Barro Colorado's tropical forest gave me a new perspective of a world I thought I knew well. I am awed by his talent; his pictures are an inspiration, as much art as they are portraits in natural history. Egbert Leigh's accompanying text is cerebral, witty, and full of answers to the 100 most common questions a novice nature lover might write down after a stroll through a tropical forest. I can't think of a better introduction to this captivating and threatened world."--Eric Dinerstein, Chief Scientist, World Wildlife Fund<p></p><br>"<em>A Magic Web</em> is as subversive as a camouflaged Morpho butterfly. One moment you are looking at the dead leaf of a page, the next moment, you are chasing brilliant blue flashing wings through the forest and the next, you find you have learned all the fundamental principles of rainforest ecology. Egbert Leigh's deft touch and satirical metaphors lead you irresistibly onward, to see how competition and cooperation together shape the intricacy of species, and of science, in the magic rainforest of Barro Colorado." --Alison Jolly, author of <em>Lucy's Legacy</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Unstoppable Confidence: How To Use The Power Of Nlp To Be More Dynamic And Successful</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;If you are serious about gaining more confidence, you must get this book!&#x201d;<br> --Robert Allen, bestselling author of <i>The One Minute Millionaire</i></b></p> <p>Imagine having the confidence and courage to go after your goals: a successful career; a rewarding relationship; a richer, fuller life. If you can dream it, you can do it--using the scientific methods of Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP). Through NLP, author Kent Sayre transformed himself from a painfully shy introvert into one of the nation's most dynamic NLP trainers. He's taught thousands how to break out of their shells and go after their dreams. Now, with his proven system, you too can harness the power of NLP and:</p> <ul><li>Blast out of your comfort zone </li><li>Shatter your limiting beliefs </li><li>Boost your confidence--instantly!</li></ul> <p>This isn't a collection of &#x201c;pie in the sky&#x201d; theories and &#x201c;go for it&#x201d; pep talks. It's a step-by-step program of ready-to-use tools, verbal and nonverbal techniques, and practical thinking exercises that direct your mind toward your goals. You'll be amazed how easy it is to interact with others; embrace opportunities; and enjoy parties, activities, work functions, and more.</p> <p><b>&#x201c;This wonderful book will give you the boost toward success that can make all the difference!&#x201d;<br> --Brian Tracy, author of <i>Maximum Achievement</i></b></p></p><p>Much of the material yet not all is based upon Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). NLP is the study of how language, both verbal and nonverbal, affects our minds. By consciously directing our minds, we can create resourceful ways of behaving for ourselves. In this book, all of the methods are geared toward having more confidence in our lives and stepping beyond our previously defined limits. <p>One of the NLP presuppositions is that since we all share the same neurology, that means whatever anyone can do, you can do as well provided that you direct your mind in exactly the same way. That means if something is possible for others, it&#x2019;s possible for you too. If confidence is possible for others (and it definitely is), it is definitely possible for you too. Using NLP methods, I have modeled very confident people and included what they do in this book. By doing what they do, you will achieve the same resourceful states of confidence that they have. From how confident people think about things to how they speak to how they carry their bodies, you will find in this book how confident people move through the world.</p><p><b>Kent Sayre</b> is a certified NLP trainer who conducts workshops and lectures on the West Coast.</p></p><h2>Tropic Death</h2><p><p><strong>Finally available after three decades, a lost classic of the Harlem Renaissance that Langston Hughes acclaimed for its &#x201c;hard poetic beauty.&#x201d;</strong></p> Eric Walrond (1898&#x2013;1966), in his only book, injected a profound Caribbean sensibility into black literature. His work was closest to that of Jean Toomer and Zora Neale Hurston with its striking use of dialect and its insights into the daily lives of the people around him. Growing up in British Guiana, Barbados, and Panama, Walrond first published <em>Tropic Death</em> to great acclaim in 1926. This book of stories viscerally charts the days of men working stone quarries or building the Panama Canal, of women tending gardens and rearing needy children. Early on addressing issues of skin color and class, Walrond imbued his stories with a remarkable compassion for lives controlled by the whims of nature. Despite his early celebrity, he died in London in 1966 with minimal recognition given to his passing.

Separating fact from fiction, he explores how emigrants dealt with spousal abuse, homicide, robbery, organized crime, and larceny. He also looks into famous episodes of executions.

The first edition of this book, <i>Programming Perl,</i> hit the shelves in 1990, and was quickly adopted as the undisputed bible of the language. Since then, Perl has grown with the times, and so has this book.<i>Programming Perl</i> is not just a book about Perl. It is also a unique introduction to the language and its culture, as one might expect only from its authors. Larry Wall is the inventor of Perl, and provides a unique perspective on the evolution of Perl and its future direction. Tom Christiansen was one of the first champions of the language, and lives and breathes the complexities of Perl internals as few other mortals do. Jon Orwant is the editor of<i>The Perl Journal,</i> which has brought together the Perl community as a common forum for new developments in Perl.Any Perl book can show the syntax of Perl's functions, but only this one is a comprehensive guide to all the nooks and crannies of the language. Any Perl book can explain typeglobs, pseudohashes, and closures, but only this one shows how they really work. Any Perl book can say that <i>my</i> is faster than <i>local,</i> but only this one explains why. Any Perl book can have a title, but only this book is affectionately known by all Perl programmers as "The Camel."This third edition of <i>Programming Perl</i> has been expanded to cover version 5.6 of this maturing language. New topics include threading, the compiler, Unicode, and other new features that have been added since the previous edition.</p></p><p>Larry Wall wrote Perl and he wrote <i>Programming Perl</i>. Better yet, he writes amusingly and well--all of which comes across in this latest edition of the definitive guide to the language.<p> Like Topsy, Perl just grew, and as a result the need for a third edition came about. It's now over 1,000 pages, which it needs to be, as it performs several different duties. First, it's an introduction to the Perl language for those who are new to programming; also, it's a guide for those who are coming from other languages; and, finally, it's a Perl language reference. </p><p> Among Larry Wall's other pursuits is being a linguist, and it's perhaps for this reason that Perl is a peculiarly flexible language with many routes to achieving the same ends, as the authors ably demonstrate. It's also extensible in several ways, designed to work with many other languages. Also, as it's largely interpreted, programs written in Perl tend to run unmodified on a variety of platforms--although platform-specific Perl modules and programming practices are also discussed.</p><p> A major strength of <i>Programming Perl</i> is the way subject areas are approached from several directions. This constant shift of viewpoint eliminates blind spots in the reader's understanding and provides a pleasing echo of the way Perl itself can take many routes from here to there. </p><p> Because the Perl community is both knowledgeable and active, the language covers much more ground here than in the previous edition. Even if you have both previous editions, you'll want this latest version--if only for the new jokes. <i>--Steve Patient, amazon.co.uk</i></p><p>Larry Wall originally created Perl while a programmer at Unisys. He now works full time guiding the future development of the language as a researcher and developer at O'Reilly &amp; Associates. Larry is known for his idiosyncratic and thought-provoking approach to programming, as well as for his groundbreaking contributions to the culture of free software programming. He is the principal author of the bestselling Programming Perl, known colloquially as "the Camel book."</p><p>Tom Christiansen is a freelance consultant specializing in Perl training and writing. After working for several years for TSR Hobbies (of Dungeons and Dragons fame), he set off for college where he spent a year in Spain and five in America, dabbling in music, linguistics, programming, and some half-dozen different spoken languages. Tom finally escaped UW-Madison with B.A.s in Spanish and computer science and an M.S. in computer science. He then spent five years at Convex as a jack-of-all-trades working on everything from system administration to utility and kernel development, with customer support and training thrown in for good measure. Tom also served two terms on the USENIX Association Board of directors. With over fifteen years' experience in UNIX system administration and programming, Tom presents seminars internationally. Living in the foothills above Boulder, Colorado, surrounded by mule deer, skunks, and the occasional mountain lion and black bear, Tom takes summers off for hiking, hacking, birding, music making, and gaming.</p><p>Jon Orwant, a well-known member of the Perl community, founded The Perl Journal and co-authored OReillys bestseller, Programming Perl, 3rd Edition.</p></p><h2>Balm in Gilead: Journey of a Healer (Radcliffe Biography Series)</h2><p>Professor Lightfoot candidly conveys the strength, endurance, and reliance upon a supportive family that pushed a Black woman, the author&#39;s mother, on to become a distinguished child psychoanalist in the face of racism, sexism, and poverty</p><p>In telling the story of her mother, Margaret Lawrence, one of the first black psychoanalysts, Lightfoot, professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, charts a generational history within the parameters of the racial history of the United States. Brought up in the early years of this century in strictly segregated Mississippi, Lawrence was sent to Harlem to complete high school. There, and later at Cornell, where she was the only black undergraduate, and at Columbia University Medical School, she experienced a more subtle but equally noxious racism. Until she retired from Harlem Hospital at age 70, Lawrence spent most of her working life in or near New York City, assisting Benjamin Spock and others in pioneering therapeutic services for children. Beginning with her grandmother, a strong line of women supported her. As related here to her daughter, Lawrence's recollections of these women and their place in the black culture of their day, which was also governed by color of skin and gender, make this a candid illumination devoid of rancor. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jeff Herman's Guide to Book Publishers, Editors &amp; Literary Agents, 28th edition: Who They Are, What They Want, How to Win Them Over (Jeff Herman's ...

In the unions and the factories, repression was accompanied by a mass campaign for democracy. Party leaders urged workers to criticize and remove corrupt and negligent officials. Workers, shop foremen, local Party members, and union leaders adopted the slogans of repression and used them, often against each other, to redress long-standing grievances.

From the mid-1920s until his death in 1976, Sudek photographed everything&#x2015;the Gothic and Baroque architecture, the streets and objects&#x2015;usually leaving the frame free of people. Because he was reclusive, a large portion of Sudek&#x2019;s work was captured through his studio window: he was particularly fond of how the glass refracted light. The <i>Window of My Studio</i> series, spanning from the beginning of the Second World War to the first half of the 1950s, presents the series, which was of fundamental importance to Sudek, for it caused his work to move further into a surreal or Magic Realist style, with blurred images and strong shadows. Photography historian Anna F�rov� contributes an introduction and an extensive biographical chronology to this volume&#x2015;now back in print&#x2015;which also includes a complete bibliography of portfolios, books and catalogues of Sudek&#x2019;s work.</p><p>&#34;Josef Sudek lived from 1896 to 1976. The photographer co-founded the Czech Photographic Society in 1924, achieving great and constant commercial success soon after.&#34;</p><h2>Rose Rosse Commissario+cd (Imparare Leggendo)</h2><p>This beautiful Italian reader is part of the collection :&#34;Imparare Leggendo&#34; (CIDEB).

Concisely and lucidly expressed, it is intended as a supplementary text for the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student who has had a first course in ordinary differential equations.<br>The author begins with a general discussion of the linear equation and develops the notions of a fundamental system of solutions, the Wronskian, and the corresponding fundamental matrix. He then introduces the nonhomogeneous linear equation and the important variation of parameters formula, by which, following a consideration of the <i>n</i>th-order linear equation, the solution of the nonhomogeneous <i>n</i>th-order linear equation is obtained. A chapter is then devoted to the linear equation with constant coefficients.<br>The two following chapters are introductory discussions of stability theory for autonomous and nonautonomous systems. Included here are two results for nonlinear systems, Liapunov&#x2019;s direct method, and some results for the second-order linear equation. The final chapter takes up the problems of the existence and uniqueness of solutions and related topics. Two appendixes &#x2014; &#x201c;Series Solutions of Second-Order Linear Equations&#x201d; and &#x201c;Linear Systems with Periodic Coefficients&#x201d; &#x2014; are also provided, and there are problems at the end of each chapter.</p><p></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Computing Essentials 2019</h2><p>The rate of change in the digital information age is clearly increasing, and computer literacy is becoming a prerequisite.

Historically, these idiosyncratic, small-circulation outlets have served the dual functions of representing the avant-garde of literary expression while also helping many emerging writers become established authors. Although changing technology and the increasingly harsh financial realities of publishing over the past three decades would seem to have pushed little magazines to the brink of extinction, their story is far more complicated.<br> <br> In this collection, Ian Morris and Joanne Diaz gather the reflections of twenty-three prominent editors whose little magazines have flourished over the past thirty-five years. Highlighting the creativity and innovation driving this diverse and still vital medium, contributors offer insights into how their publications sometimes succeeded, sometimes reluctantly folded, but mostly how they evolved and persevered. Other topics discussed include the role of little magazines in promoting the work and concerns of minority and women writers, the place of universities in supporting and shaping little magazines, and the online and offline future of these publications.<br> <br> <i>Selected contributors</i><br> <b>Betsy Sussler, <i>BOMB</i>; Lee Gutkind, <i>Creative Nonfiction</i>; Bruce Andrews, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E; Dave Eggers, <i>McSweeney&#x2019;s</i>; Keith Gessen, <i>n+1</i>; Don Share, <i>P</i></b><b><i>oetry</i>; Jane Friedman, <i>VQR</i>; A</b><b>my Hoffman, <i>Women&#x2019;s Review of Books</i>; and more.</b><br> </p></p><p><b>Ian Morris </b>has taught courses on literature, writing, and publishing at Lake Forest College and Columbia College.

She was an assistant editor at <i>TriQuarterly </i>and is the author of two collections of poetry, <i>The Lessons </i>and <i>My Favorite Tyrants</i>."Little magazines, known for their experimental nature and independent spirit, are the focus of this absorbing collection of essays, written by leading editors working over the past thirty years.&nbsp;This fascinating anthology brings to life the literary, cultural, and political landscapes intrinsic to avant-garde publications and deepens our understanding of their immense significance.&nbsp;This book takes its rightful place on library shelves next to earlier classics <i>The Little Magazine: A History and Bibliography</i> and <i>The Little Magazine in America.&nbsp; </i>It&#x2019;s an indispensable tool for scholars and a great read!" (<i>Karen Gisonny, New York Public Library</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A thoughtful and much-needed champion of the vitality and creativity of literary journals today.&#x201d; (<i>The Paris Review</i>)<br><br>"Little magazines are crucial to the literary health of our country. Today, we are inundated with a bottom-line publishing ideal. In the face of conglomerate money culture, we need our littles more than ever. This book is essential." (<i>Bill Henderson, founder and editor of Pushcart Press</i>)<br><br>"At the zenith of print culture, modernist writers aspired to renew civilization or dynamite it, to subvert consumer capitalism or make a name or a buck from it, in a relatively new print genre&#x2014;the little magazine. Morris and Diaz have now asked a score of the little magazine editors and writers who have shaped our own literary culture to reflect on the present and future of the genre &#x201c;during the most radical paradigm shift since the invention of movable type.&#x201d; This collection reassures us that the internet not only affords new modes of writing and reading but also leaves plenty of room for print experiments&#x2014;from zines and boxes of printed documents to the survivals of modernist-era or university-based magazines.&nbsp; Future readers will look back to <i>The Little Magazine in Contemporary America</i> as a key document of the American literary periodicals of our age." (<i>Mark Morrisson, Pennsylvania State University</i>)<br><br><i>"The Little Magazine in Contemporary America </i>is a fascinating set of responses to the two great changes in writing and reading since 1980.&nbsp; The first is the internet, which has given a new face to the drive of letters toward action-for-change, enabling immediate distribution of readers&#x2019; insights in answer to the work of artists&#x2014;and in answer to postings by other web readers.&nbsp; A little magazine today can speak to audiences who never read the magazine itself; they can gather around the magazine&#x2019;s comment sites for warmth, argument, and validation. The second great change in the world of letters during the past 35 years is&nbsp;the transformative effect of creative nonfiction as a cross-genre mode.&nbsp; For it has encouraged heady mixtures and a renewal of rhetorical poise in the art of many fine poets and prose writers, breathing delight into the work of making it new." (<i>Mary Kinzie, Northwestern University</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;The Little Magazine in Contemporary America</i> is an important book&#x2015;one that is long overdue. It provides a different perspective on the role of little magazines that is valuable and not readily available anywhere elsewhere. Particularly impressive are Jane Friedman&#x2019;s and Don Share&#x2019;s essays, which wrap up the entire volume brilliantly, both giving a sense of the potential for independent magazines in the future while acknowledging the rich history of the past.&#x201d; (<i>Jodee Stanley, University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Little Magazine in Contemporary America</i>, a much more manageable collection of interviews and essays that was published in April, looks at the years since then, the years that included&#x2014;so say the book&#x2019;s editors, Ian Morris and Joanne Diaz&#x2014; &#x201c;the end of the ascendancy of print periodicals,&#x201d; meaning that the best small litmags have moved online....A new journal needs a reason to exist: a gap that earlier journals failed to fill, a new form of pleasure, a new kind of writing, an alliance with a new or under-chronicled social movement, a constellation of authors for whom the future demand for work exceeds present supply, a program that will actually change some small part of some literary readers&#x2019; tastes. None of this has changed with the rise of the Web. Nor has the other big truth about little magazines which emerges from Diaz and Morris&#x2019;s book, or from a day spent with anybody who runs one: it&#x2019;s exhausting, albeit exciting, to do it yourself." (<i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been thirty-five years since the last comprehensive examination of little magazines, during which time the advent of the Internet and evolving publishing constrictions have presented unique challenges to these little engines that could. Morris and Diaz&#x2019;s anthology...addresses these challenges and the ways in which many little magazines have turned them into advantages, including the opportunity for more and specialized promotion and differentiation. Public discussion and debate is essential to literary and artistic work, and these essays speak to the opportunity for this collective conversation to reach a wider audience in the digital age. <i>The Little Magazine in Contemporary America</i> is a welcome and compelling update, one that offers substantive hope for the future and continued significance of its subject.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Newcity</i>)</p><h2>The Neural Control of Sleep and Waking</h2><p>Why we need to sleep is not actually known, but it is a topic that continues to intrigue us and it is still very much the subject of active research.

FUNDAMENTALS OF ECOLOGY was first published in 1953 and was the vehicle Odum used to educate a wide audience about ecological science. This Fifth Edition of FUNDAMENTALS OF ECOLOGY is co-authored by Odum&#39;s protege Gary Barrett and represents the last academic text Odum produced. The text retains its classic holistic approach to ecosystem science, but incorporates and integrates an evolutionary approach as well. In keeping with a greater temporal/spatial approach to ecology, new chapters in landscape ecology, regional ecology, and global ecology have been added building on the levels-of-organization hierarchy. Also, a final chapter entitled &#34;Statistical Thinking for Students of Ecology&#34; provides a quantitative synthesis to the field of statistics. Contemporary and engaging, this text brings clarity and specificity to the study of ecology in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Gene Odum completed a Ph.D. in zoology with a major in ecology from the University of Illinois and served a year as resident naturalist at the Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve in Rensselaerville, N.Y. He obtained the initial grant from the Atomic Energy Commission that established the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory. In 1970, the year he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, Odum gained statewide fame for demonstrating the economic value of Georgia�s undeveloped wetlands and thereby helping amass political support for the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act. Gene Odum is the recipient of the highest honors given in ecology � the Prix de l�Institut de la Vie and the Crafoord Prize.<br><br>Gary W.

Edmund Husserl, who was initially a mathematician, discusses this general question extensively, but although his views influenced the Dutch intuitionists and were taken very seriously by G�del, they have not been widely appreciated among analytical philosophers. In this book Robert Tragesser sets out to determine the conditions under which a realist ontology of mathematics and logic might be justified, taking as his starting point Husserl&#39;s treatment of these metaphysical problems. He does not aim primarily at an exposition of Husserl&#39;s phenomenology, although many of the central claims of phenomenology are clarified here. Rather he exploits its ideas and methods to show how they can contribute to answering Michael Dummet&#39;s question &#39;Realism or Anti-Realism?&#39;. In doing so he makes a challenging and provocative contribution to the debate.</p><p>Edmund Husserl discusses the question of whether the world is of our making or whether some form of realism is true.

Together, these two volumes present a detailed study of stairs and ramps - the art and science of their design, their history, and their hazards.<br> <br> For the designer and the art and architectural historian, the first volume treats the fascinating history of stairs and their immense influence on the art and science of architecture. It is illustrated with more than 100 photographs from around the world and reviews the literature on stairs (as well as ladders and railings and ramps) from Vitruvius to Venturi. Templer considers the whole play of meanings in the idea of the stair - as art object, as structural idea, as legal prescription, or as poetic fancy - making it clear that the stair is simultaneously an aesthetic, architectonic, ergonomic, and cultural element.<br> <br> The second volume shows the dangers stairs present. Drawing on twenty years of human factors research on stairs, Templer sets out what is known about slips, trips, and falls and how best to design stairs to avoid their inherent dangers. He discusses the physiological and behavioral relationship between humans and stairs and walkways, the question of gait and slippery surfaces, and the various types of falls and the injuries that result. Perhaps most importantly, Templer proposes the idea of the soft stair, which could substantially reduce the annual epidemic of stair-related deaths and injuries.<br> <br> John Templer is Regents' Professor of Architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

The standard edition has an attractive jacket design. Each title chosen for it&#39;s literary quality and for the untold pleasure it will give readers of all ages.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>A Companion to the Ancient Greek Language</h2><p>A comprehensive account of the language of Ancient Greek civilization in a single volume, with contributions from leading international scholars covering the historical, geographical, sociolinguistic, and literary perspectives of the language. <ul> <li> A collection of 36 original essays by a team of international scholars </li> <li> Treats the survival and transmission of Ancient Greek </li> <li> Includes discussions on phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics </li> </ul></p><p><p>"The work is wonderfully clear, informative, and engaging.

Symphonies, chamber music, opera, church music, and songs (more than 600 of them) poured forth in profusion. His "Trout" Quintet, his "Unfinished" Symphony, the last three piano sonatas, and above all his song cycles Die Schone Mullerin and Winterreise have come to be universally regarded as belonging to the very greatest works of music? Who was the man who composed this amazing succession of masterpieces, so many of which were either entirely ignored or regarded as failures during his lifetime? In this new biography, Elizabeth McKay paints a vivid portrait of Schubert and his world. She explores his family background, his education and musical upbringing, his friendships, and his brushes and flirtations with the repressive authorities of Church and State. She discusses his experience of the arts, literature, and theater, and his relations with the professional and amateur musical world of his day. She traces the way Schubert's manic-depression became an increasingly significant influence in his life, responsible at least in part for social inadequacies, professional ineptitude, and idiosyncrasies in his music. And she examines Schubert's decline after he contracted syphilis, looking at its effect on his music and emotional life.<br></p><p>The author may not be especially inspired, but she&#39;s very readable, and she takes a straightforward approach to Schubert&#39;s life. She discusses the nature of Schubert&#39;s &#34;sexual profligacy&#34; and the possibility of his being homosexual without coming down on one side or the other. She believes that Schubert was manic-depressive (and that several other members of his family were as well), and advances some convincing evidence for her view. This is a worthwhile addition to the shelf of Schubert biographies, a shelf that is certain to continue to expand in the bicentenary year of his birth.Franz Schubert (1797-1828) was born in Vienna of immigrant parents. During his short life he produced an astonishing amount of music. Symphonies, chamber music, opera, church music, and songs (more than 600 of them) poured forth in profusion. His &#39;Trout&#39; Quintet, his &#39;Unfinished&#39; Symphony, the three last piano sonatas, and above all his song cycles Die Schone Mullerin and Winterreise have come to be universally regarded as belonging to the very greatest works of music. Who was the man who composed this amazing succession of masterpieces, so many of which were either entirely ignored or regarded as failures during his lifetime? In her new biography, Elizabeth Norman McKay paints a vivid portrait of Schubert and his world. She explores his family background, his education and musical upbringing, his friendships, and his brushes and flirtations with the repressive authorities of Church and State. She discusses his experience of the arts, literature and theatre, and his relations with the professional and amateur musical world of his day. Schubert&#39;s manic-depressive temperament became of increasing significance in his life, and McKay shows how it was partly responsible for his social inadequacies, professional ineptitude, and idiosyncracies in his music. She examines Schubert&#39;s uneven physical decline after he contracted syphilis, traces its effects on his music, his hedonism, and sensuality, and investigates the cause and circumstances of his death at the age of 31.</p><h2>Dancing Barefoot</h2><p><p>Wil Wheaton--blogger, geek, and Star Trek: The Next Generation's Wesley Crusher--gives us five short-but-true tales of life in the so-called Space Age in <i>Dancing Barefoot</i>. With a true geek's unflinching honesty, Wil examines life, love, the web, and the absurdities of Hollywood in these compelling autobiographical narratives. Based on pieces first published in Wil's hugely popular blog, www.wilwheaton.net, the stories in <i>Dancing Barefoot</i> chronicle a teen TV star's journey to maturity and self-acceptance. Far from the usual celebrity tell-all, <i>Dancing Barefoot</i> is a vivid account of one man's version of that universal story, the search for self. If you've ever fallen in love, wondered what goes on behind the scenes at a Star Trek convention, or thought hard about the meaning of life, you'll find a kindred soul in the pages of Dancing Barefoot. In the process of uncovering his true geeky self, Wil Wheaton speaks to the inner geek in all of us.The stories:Houses in Motion - Memories fill the emptiness left within a childhood home, and saying goodbye brings them to life.Ready Or Not Here I Come - A game of hide-n-seek with the kids works as a time machine, taking Wil on a tour of the hiding and seeking of years gone by.Inferno - Two 15-year-olds pass in the night leaving behind pleasant memories and a perfumed Car Wars Deluxe Edition Box Set.We Close Our Eyes - A few beautiful moments spent dancing in the rain.The Saga of SpongeBob VegasPants - A story of love, hate, laughter and the acceptance of all things Trek.</p></p><p>There are five stories, spanning 30 years, in these pages. They originally appeared on my website, WIL WHEATON DOT NET. <p>I liked them so much, I intended to include them in Just A Geek, but they didn't fit. So they get to live here, with some wonderful illustrations to keep them company. </p><p>Some of them are funny, one is very sad, one is pretty damn sentimental, but they are all true. I wrote them shortly after my 30th birthday, as I looked to my past in an attempt to understand my present, and not fear my future. </p><p>I gave birth to this book when I wrote it. By reading it, you give it life. Take good care of my babies.</p><p>Wil Wheaton may be one of the most unusual celebrities of our time. Born into stardom with the movie "Stand By Me", and then growing up on television as Wesley Crusher on "Star Trek: The Next Generation", Wil was in the spotlight nearly his entire childhood. Instead of burning out as a child star, he left fame behind and became a computer specialist in what Hollywood might consider the middle of nowhere: Topeka, Kansas. Now, Wil considers himself "just a geek", and both Dancing Barefoot and the forthcoming biography Just a Geek are about his journey in rediscovering himself and coming to terms with what it means to be famous, or, ironically, famous for being previously famous.</p></p><h2>Cryptography: Theory and Practice (Textbooks in Mathematics)</h2><p><p>Through three editions, <b><i>Cryptography: Theory and Practice</i></b>, has been embraced by instructors and students alike.

But do we really understand what is meant by "Federal Reserve independence"? Using scores of examples from the Fed's rich history, <i>The Power and Independence of the Federal Reserve</i> shows that much common wisdom about the nation's central bank is inaccurate. Legal scholar and financial historian Peter Conti-Brown provides an in-depth look at the Fed's place in government, its internal governance structure, and its relationships to such individuals and groups as the president, Congress, economists, and bankers.</p><br><p>Exploring how the Fed regulates the global economy and handles its own internal politics, and how the law does&#x2015;and does not&#x2015;define the Fed's power, Conti-Brown captures and clarifies the central bank's defining complexities. He examines the foundations of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which established a system of central banks, and the ways that subsequent generations have redefined the organization. Challenging the notion that the Fed Chair controls the organization as an all-powerful technocrat, he explains how institutions and individuals&#x2015;within and outside of government&#x2015;shape Fed policy. Conti-Brown demonstrates that the evolving mission of the Fed&#x2015;including systemic risk regulation, wider bank supervision, and as a guardian against inflation and deflation&#x2015;requires a reevaluation of the very way the nation's central bank is structured.</p><br><p>Investigating how the Fed influences and is influenced by ideologies, personalities, law, and history, <i>The Power and Independence of the Federal Reserve</i> offers a clear picture of this uniquely important institution.</p></p><p><p>"Critiques of central banking have for too long been the preserve of economists and insiders, while legal scholars and political scientists concentrated on the regulatory state. Scholarly and stimulating, <i>The Power and Independence of the Federal Reserve</i> breaks this mold and deserves to attract wide interest and discussion."<b>--Paul Tucker, former deputy governor, Bank of England and senior fellow, Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Business School</b></p><p>"This excellent book focuses on the operations and governance of the Federal Reserve. With an entertaining style and sound justification, Conti-Brown concludes that there are too many diverse functions and policymakers within the Fed, and he offers sensible policy alternatives. His book is essential reading for anyone concerned about monetary policy and the role of the Fed, and central banking more widely."<b>--Charles Goodhart, emeritus professor, London School of Economics</b></p><p>"Is it possible to write a fascinating, original, and even literary book on the power and independence of the Federal Reserve? Yes, because Peter Conti-Brown has done it. His unique blend of historical narrative, legal analysis, and economic knowledge distinguishes this remarkable book from anything ever written about the Fed. Readers may not agree with all of Conti-Brown's conclusions, some of which are highly controversial. But everyone will learn something new."<b>--Alan S. Blinder, author of <i>After the Music Stopped</i></b></p><p>"Debates about the Federal Reserve often pit advocates of Fed independence against those who believe the Fed should be regularly audited or even abolished. In this highly readable work, Peter Conti-Brown shows both views are mistaken. Along the way, he uncovers forgotten heroes of Fed history, offers the clearest explanation yet of the Fed's maneuvers during and after the 2008 crisis, and demonstrates that the Fed's regional banks are almost certainly unconstitutional. This is an important book."<b>--David Skeel, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"Although more people than ever have become aware of the Fed in recent years, very few actually know what it does and how it actually works. This book explains the history and laws that have shaped the Fed, and provides a deep and coherent discussion of the notion of Fed independence. It makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the Federal Reserve and central banks."<b>--Anat Admati, coauthor of <i>The Bankers' New Clothes</i></b></p><p>"We know that the Federal Reserve is important, but we seldom think about the legal and political details of its daily monetary policy decisions. In this fascinating book, Conti-Brown brings a fresh and challenging perspective to almost every aspect of Fed history and its current operations."<b>--Simon Johnson, author of <i>13 Bankers</i></b></p><b>Peter Conti-Brown</b> is assistant professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

As the title suggests, this book provides an introduction to probability designed to prepare the reader for intelligent and resourceful applications in a variety of fields. Its goal is to provide a careful exposition of those concepts, interpretations, and analytical techniques needed for the study of such topics as statistics, introductory random processes, statis� tical communications and control, operations research, or various topics in the behavioral and social sciences. Also, the treatment should provide a background for more advanced study of mathematical probability or math� ematical statistics. The level of preparation assumed is indicated by the fact that the book grew out of a first course in probability, taken at the junior or senior level by students in a variety of fields-mathematical sciences, engineer� ing, physics, statistics, operations research, computer science, economics, and various other areas of the social and behavioral sciences. Students are expected to have a working knowledge of single-variable calculus, including some acquaintance with power series. Generally, they are expected to have the experience and mathematical maturity to enable them to learn new concepts and to follow and to carry out sound mathematical arguments. While some experience with multiple integrals is helpful, the essential ideas can be introduced or reviewed rather quickly at points where needed.</p><p></p><h2>Subject To Change: Creating Great Products &amp; Services for an Uncertain World: Adaptive Path on Design</h2><p><p>To achieve success in today's ever-changing and unpredictable markets, competitive businesses need to rethink and reframe their strategies across the board. Instead of approaching new product development from the inside out, companies have to begin by looking at the process from the outside in, beginning with the customer experience. It's a new way of thinking-and working-that can transform companies struggling to adapt to today's environment into innovative, agile, and commercially successful organizations.</p><p>Companies must develop a new set of organizational competencies: qualitative customer research to better understand customer behaviors and motivations; an open design process to reframe possibilities and translate new ideas into great customer experiences; and agile technological implementation to quickly prototype ideas, getting them from the whiteboard out into the world where people can respond to them.</p><p>In <i>Subject to Change: Creating Great Products and Services for an Uncertain World</i>, Adaptive Path, a leading experience strategy and design company, demonstrates how successful businesses can-and should-use customer experiences to inform and shape the product development process, from start to finish.</p></p><p>The world in which we live and work is subject to change without notice, and succeeding amidst that uncertainty requires continuous improvement. The key to creating successful products and services in a rapidly changing world is not resistance to unexpected change, but the flexibility to adapt to it.

They symbolize freedom, eternal life, the soul.<br><br> There&#x2019;s definitely a dark side to the avian. Birds of prey sometimes kill other birds (the shrike), destroy other birds&#x2019; eggs (blue jays), and even have been known to kill small animals (the kea sometimes eats live lambs). And who isn&#x2019;t disgusted by birds that eat the dead&#x2015;vultures awaiting their next meal as the life blood flows from the dying. One of our greatest fears is of being eaten by vultures before we&#x2019;re quite dead.<br><br> Is it any wonder that with so many interpretations of the avian, that the contributors herein are eager to be transformed or influenced by them? Included in <em>Black Feathers</em> are those obsessed by birds of one type or another. Do they want to become birds or just take on some of the &#x201c;power&#x201d; of birds? The presence or absence of birds portends the future. A grieving widow takes comfort in her majestic winged neighbors, who enable her to cope with a predatory relative. An isolated society of women relies on a bird to tell their fortunes. A silent young girl and her pet bird might be the only hope a detective has of tracking down a serial killer in a tourist town. A chatty parrot makes illegal deals with the dying. A troubled man lives in isolation with only one friend for company&#x2015;a jackdaw.<br><br> In each of these fictions, you will encounter the dark resonance between the human and avian. You see in yourself the savagery of a predator, the shrewd stalking of a hunter, and you are lured by birds that speak human language, that make beautiful music, that cypher numbers, and seem to have a moral center. You wade into this feathered nightmare, and brave the horror of death, trading your safety and sanity for that which we all seek&#x2015;the promise of flight.</p><p>Ellen Datlow is one of horror&#x2019;s most acclaimed editors.

Did its forces fight heroically against all odds for the cause of states' rights? In reality, these suggestions are an elaborate and intentional effort on the part of Southerners to rationalize the secession and the war itself. Unfortunately, skillful propagandists have been so successful in promoting this romanticized view that the Lost Cause has assumed a life of its own. Misrepresenting the war's true origins and its actual course, the myth of the Lost Cause distorts our national memory. In The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War History, nine historians describe and analyze the Lost Cause, identifying ways in which it falsifies history -- creating a volume that makes a significant contribution to Civil War historiography.</p></p><p><p>Gary W. Gallagher is John L. Nau III Professor of History at the University of Virginia. He has written or edited a number of books in the field of Civil War--era history, including, most recently, The Confederate War, Lee and His Generals in War and Memory; and Causes Won, Lost, and Forgotten: How Hollywood and Popular Art Shape What We Know about the Civil War.</p><p>Alan T. Nolan (1923--2008) is author of Lee Considered: Robert E. Lee and Civil War History and The Iron Brigade: A Military History (IUP, 1994), and editor (with Sharon Eggleston Vipond) of Giants in Their Tall Black Hats: Essays on the Iron Brigade (IUP, 1998).</p>The South lost the Civil War, but southerners have certainly held their own in the postwar battle to shape historical interpretations of the conflict. Southern politicians, war veterans, and historians successfully promoted the "Lost Cause" view of the origins and results of our national nightmare. The South, so the story goes, wanted to preserve its unique culture, and slavery was not a fundamental basis of that culture. Led by valiant gentlemen-officers (e.g., Robert E. Lee) and brave, defiant common soldiers, the Confederacy struggled against insurmountable odds, eventually succumbing to numerically but not morally superior forces. This collection of essays by nine Civil War scholars shows how the myth was consciously propagated by southerners, often in an attempt to rationalize the physical and social carnage left by the war. These essays are well reasoned and timely, given current controversies raging over the display of the Confederate battle flag. This will be a valuable addition to Civil War collections. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

King's move took place just before African American students in the South reclaimed the energy of the Montgomery bus boycott with their bold sit-in protests, which King predicted would become "an integral part of the history which is reshaping the world, replacing a dying order with modern democracy." He was arrested in October after participating in a sit-in protest in Atlanta. His resulting imprisonment led presidential candidate John F. Kennedy to phone his sympathies to King's wife, Coretta, a move many credit for providing the margin of victory in the close election of 1960.</p><p>"The editors continue their excellent work. One has a poignant sense of King at the end of his twenties, famous, with a full diary, innumerable demands, a knife scar above his heart, and an unfulfilled mission in his soul."--Peter J. Ling, American and Canadian Studies, University of Nottingham<p>"What a gold mine. The introduction is an extraordinary work of scholarship, not simply extending my understanding of King and the movement, but extending it by putting King in the larger contexts of the late fifties."--Ira Berlin, Professor of History, University of Maryland at College Park</p><b>Clayborne Carson</b> is Director and Senior Editor of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Papers Project and Professor of History at Stanford University. <b>Tenisha Armstrong,</b> Associate Editor, is a graduate of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Comprising 100 tales told by ten young people who have retreated to the countryside to escape the plague raging through fourteenth-century Florence, the work is a perfect example of classic Italian prose.<br>This volume contains a carefully chosen selection of 20 of its best-known tales, including those that inspired later works by Chaucer, Shakespeare, Gotthold Lessing, Keats, and other writers. Spiced with humor, rich dialogue, and colorful characters, the stories range from earthy satires to morality tales, from accounts of adulterous love and passion to suspenseful narratives of murder and revenge. Among them are such favorites as "The Pot of Basil," "Patient Griselda," the bawdy "Putting the Devil Back in Hell," "A Wager over Virtue," "The Stone of Invisibility," and "The Wild Hunt."<br>For this dual-language edition, Stanley Appelbaum has provided an informative, thoughtful introduction and excellent new English translations on pages facing the Italian original. Sure to delight students of Italian language and literature, the volume will appeal as well to readers interested in classic medieval stories.<br><br></p><p><p>This edition presents 33 of the 100 tales, with at least two from each of the ten days of storytelling. Boccaccio&#x2019;s general introduction and conclusion to the work are also included, as are the introduction and conclusion to the first day; the reader is thus provided with a real sense of the <em>Decameron&#x2019;s</em> framing narrative. Extensive explanatory notes are provided, and the volume is prefaced by a concise but wide-ranging introduction to Boccaccio&#x2019;s life and times, as well as to the <em>Decameron</em> itself. A unique selection of contextual materials concludes the volume. </p>Stanley Appelbaum served for decades as Dover&#39;s Editor in Chief until his retirement in 1996.

This compelling book introduces a bold new theory on this unsolved mystery. Author Richard Klein reexamines the archaeological evidence and brings in new discoveries in the study of the human brain. These studies detail the changes that enabled humans to think and behave in far more sophisticated ways than before, resulting in the incredibly rapid evolution of new skills. Richard Klein has been described as ""the premier anthropologist in the country today"" by Evolutionary Anthropology. Here, he and coauthor Blake Edgar shed new light on the full story of a truly fascinating period of evolution.</p><p><b>Richard G. Klein</b>, PhD (Palo Alto, CA), is a Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University. He is the author of the definitive academic book on the subject of the origins of human culture, The Human Career.

He has written extensively for Discover, GEO, and numerous other magazines.</p></p><p>"The premier anthropologist in the country today."<br>-Evolutionary Anthropology on Richard Klein<br><br>"High above the western shore of Lake Naivasha, a blue pool on the parched floor of East Africa's Great Rift Valley, sits a small rockshelter carved into the Mau Escarpment. Maasai pastoralists who once occupied this region in central Kenya called the place Enkapune Ya Muto, or 'Twilight Cave.' People have long sought shelter there. The cave's sediments record important cultural changes during the past few thousand years, including the first local experiments with agriculture and with sheep and goat domestication. Buried more than three meters deep in the sand, silt, and loam at Enkapune Ya Muto, however, lie the traces of an earlier and even more significant event in human prehistory. Tens of thousands of pieces of obsidian, a jet-black volcanic glass, were long ago fashioned into finger-length knives with scalpel-sharp edges, thumbnail-sized scrapers, and other stone tools, made on the spot at an ancient workshop. But what most impressed archeologist Stanley Ambrose were nearly six hundred fragments of ostrich eggshell, including thirteen that had been fashioned into disk-shaped beads about a quarter-inch in diameter. Forty thousand years ago, a person or persons crouched near the mouth of Enkapune Ya Muto to drill holes through angular fragments of ostrich eggshell and to grind the edges of each piece until only a delicate ring remained. Many shell fragments snapped in half under pressure from the stone drill or from the edge-grinding that followed. The craftspeople discarded each broken piece and began again with a fresh fragment of shell.<br><br>"Ambrose believes that these ancient beads played a key role in the survival strategy of the craftspeople and their families. In the Kalahari Desert of Botswana, !Kung San hunter-gatherers still practice a system of gift exchange known as hxaro. Certain items, such as food, are readily shared among the !Kung but never exchanged as gifts. The most appropriate gifts for all occasions just happen to be strands of ostrich eggshell beads. The generic word for gift is synonymous with the !Kung word for sewn beadwork. Although the nomadic !Kung carry the barest minimum of personal possessions, they invest considerable time and energy in creating eggshell beads.<br><br>"No one knows whether the toolmakers at Enkapune Ya Muto or the other ancient African sites intended their ostrich eggshell beads to be social gifts. But if these beads were invested with symbolic meaning similar to that of beads among the !Kung, then Twilight Cave may record the dawning of modern human behavior."<br>-From The Dawn of Human CultureThe Dawn of Human Culture<br><br>Some fifty thousand years ago Homo sapiens, the newest branch of a long and varied tree of evolved apes, suddenly developed a remarkable range of new talents. These people-whose primitive stone culture had previously been little different from that of their ancestors-began painting. They invented music and the instruments to play it. They fashioned jewelry and clothing, created fishing poles and tackle as well as bows and arrows, constructed the oldest substantial houses, and buried their dead with ritual and ceremony. This creative explosion, occurring over such a remarkably short period, has been called the "big bang" of human culture.<br><br>It was the fourth in a series of punctuated events that have marked the history of human evolution. The first occurred between seven and five million years ago when a group of African apes, in response to shrinking forests and expanding open savannas, began to walk upright. These are the bipedal apes of which Lucy and her kin are the most famous. The next occurred about two and a half million years ago, again during a time of global climatic change resulting in major environmental disruption, when the first stone-tool makers emerged. The third occurred about 1.8 million years ago when humans developed modern body proportions and colonized largely treeless environments for the first time.<br><br>So what accelerated our cultural development? What made us who we are?<br><br>Now, for the first time, preeminent anthropologist Richard Klein tackles this mystery, one of the great enigmas of our evolution. With Blake Edgar, he works his way forward through time as Homo developed, looking for clues, discarding false leads, and examining why other species of man such as the Neanderthals failed to develop a similar culture-and failed to survive. He reexamines the archeological evidence, including the latest findings, and considers new discoveries in the study of human genetics. This journey leads him to a bold new theory involving the brain that could solve the mystery of our origins and that points the way for future studies.</p><h2>The Valley of Fear (Dover Value Editions)</h2><p>"Look down the valley! See the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it! I tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people. It is the Valley of Fear, the Valley of Death. The terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn." So declares a resident of a mining town, where a sinister secret society maintains its stranglehold on the community with a series of violent crimes.<br><i>The Valley of Fear,</i> the last of the four Sherlock Holmes novels, ranks among Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's best work. The mystery begins with a coded warning of imminent danger, drawing the illustrious Sherlock Holmes and the faithful Dr. Watson to a secluded English country home. A trail of bewildering clues--raincoats, dumbbells, a missing wedding ring &#x2014; leads to sleuthing in the finest Holmesian tradition and the gripping backstory of a cult that terrorized a valley in the American West. Crisp, realistic characterizations and a cracklingly suspenseful narrative make this novel a must-read for all lovers of mystery and detection as well as Sherlock Holmes fans.</p><p>6 1-hour cassettesA coded warning of imminent danger sends Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to the fortress-like country house of the reclusive Jack Douglas.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they arrive too late to prevent a tragic death, the great detective and his chronicler must follow a series of bewildering clues and find a murderer who has vanished into thin air.</p><h2>Serve the People!: A Novel</h2><p>Set in 1967, at the peak of the Mao cult, <i>Serve the People! </i>is a beautifully told, wickedly daring story about the forbidden love affair between Liu Lian, the young, pretty wife of a powerful Division Commander in Communist China, and her household&#x2019;s lowly servant, Wu Dawang. When Liu Lian establishes a rule for her orderly that he is to attend to her needs whenever the household&#x2019;s wooden Serve the People! sign is removed from its usual place, the orderly vows to obey. What follows is a remarkable love story and a profound and deliciously comic satire on Mao&#x2019;s famous slogan and the political and sexual taboos of his regime. As life is breathed into&nbsp;the illicit sexual affair, Yan Lianke brilliantly captures how the Model Soldier Wu Dawang becomes an eager collaborator with the restless and demanding Liu Lian, their actions inspired by primitive passions that they are only just discovering. Originally banned in China, and the first work from Yan Lianke to be translated into English, <i>Serve the People!</i> brings us the debut of one of the most important authors writing from inside China today.</p><p>Yan Lianke was born in 1958 and is one of China&#39;s most established literary writers. His many novels and story collections have won several of China&#39;s most prestigious literary prizes. His next novel deals with blood contamination in the province where he was brought up in China and is certain to add to the controversy surrounding his work."Yan Lianke's "Serve the People!" is a scathing sendup of life in 1960s China during the chaos of the country's Cultural Revolution. Serialized in the Chinese literary magazine Hua Cheng in 2005 and then banned by the Central Propaganda Bureau, Lianke's novel takes aim at one and all, from impotent leaders and their scandalous wives to amoral People's Liberation Army soldiers scheming their way up the ranks, peasant farmers plagued by drought, and even the great Mao himself. Lianke spares no one . . . "Serve the People!" is a wonderfully biting satire, brimming with absurdity, humor and wit . . .the novel is exuberantly drawn in several shades of revolutionary (or should that be Revlon?) red." LA Times<br><br> This passionate satire of clandestine, intimate privilege in an ostensibly classless, egalitarian society is exceedingly carefully written, so that it is at once funny, sad, and bitterly ironic on nearly every page. Oh, and sensual, too.&#x201d; Ray Olson, Booklist (starred review)<br><br> Yan&#x2019;s work certainly contains its share of double entendres and may even be perceived as comedic at times, but on a deeper level, it offers a sociopolitical commentary on a way of life generally unfamiliar to Westerners.&#x201d; Library Journal<br><br> Yan&#x2019;s satire brilliantly exposes the emptiness of Maoist ideals and the fraudulent ends for which they were used, but also relates a sorrowful tale of compromised relationships and modest hopes left unfulfilled.&#x201d; Publishers Weekly<br><br> Steamy and subversive . . . Lianke [is] one of China&#x2019;s greatest living authors and fiercest satirists.&#x201d; Jonathan Watts, The Guardian<br><br> Yan Lianke&#x2019;s slim novel drips with the kind of satire that can only come from deep within the machinery of Chinese communism. Eschewing broad comedy, Yan barbs the text with enough social criticism to receive a priceless blurb from the Central Propaganda Bureau.&#x201d; Craig Taylor, Financial Times<br><br> Not just sexy, but also tender . . .

Homes in this much-loved style of architecture welcome the visitor and embrace the resident, and architects James Osborne Craig and Mary McLaughlin Craig, early proponents of the style and influential disseminators of it, were masters of the form. Their work, until now, has been largely underappreciated and little seen.&nbsp;<br>The Craigs played pivotal roles in the development of the Spanish Colonial Revival and of other styles of architecture in Santa Barbara, and the influence of their work spread much beyond that.

It is evident that because of a serious lack of professional training, experience and expertise, these patients often do not receive appropriate treatment. There are numerous examples of failure to understand cultural issues - for example ignorance of traditional family structures leading to major diagnostic and therapeutic errors. These errors include beliefs with psychiatric symptons, especially psychotic symptomatology; and lack of awareness of differences in presenting symptomatology. This book identifies some of the key problems and major pitfalls of working across cultures, and explains the theories and techniques of intercultural therapy as developed by a group of specialists who have pioneered and who practise in this developing area.</p><p></p><h2>Knowledge of Life (Forms of Living)</h2><p><p>As the work of thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Fran�ois Jacob, Louis Althusser, and Pierre Bourdieu demonstrates, Georges Canguilhem has exerted tremendous influence on the philosophy of science and French philosophy more generally. In Knowledge of Life, a book that spans twenty years of his essays and lectures, Canguilhem offers a series of epistemological histories that seek to establish and clarify the stakes, ambiguities, and emergence of philosophical and biological concepts that defined the rise of modern biology. </p><p>How do transformations in biology and modern medicine shape conceptions of life? How do philosophical concepts feed into biological ideas and experimental practices, and how are they themselves transformed? How does knowledge "undo the experience of life so as to help man remake what life has made without him, in him or outside of him?" Knowledge of Life is Canguilhem's effort to explain how the movements of knowledge and life come to rest upon each other. </p><p>Published at the dawn of the genetic revolution and still pertinent today, the book tackles the history of cell theory, the conceptual moves toward and away from mechanical understandings of the organism, the persistence of vitalism, and the nature of normality in science and its objects.</p></p><p>Trained in philosophy and medicine, Georges Canguilhem (1904-1995) remains one of France's most influential philosophers of science.<br><br>Stefanos Geroulanos is Assistant Professor of Modern European Intellectual History at New York University.

(&#x2015;Harry Marks <i>The Johns Hopkins University</i>)<br><br>After reading these essays, one might well ask, as Canguilhem did, 'What are the presuppositions that drive contemporary interpretations of science?' Currently, few seem to be asking that question . . . Canguilhem presents a metaphysical quandary that remains as vital today as when he wrote 60 years ago. (<i>&#x2015;Isis</i>)<br><br>Fordham University Press has done a splendid job in making available to the English-speaking public as an affordable paperback one of Canguilhem&#x2019;s most important contributions to the history and philosophy of biology... Each essay [in Knowledge of Life] presents a detailed epistemological history of a specific biological problem, concept, or idea in order to advance a particular philosophical thesis... Canguilhem&#x2019;s writing is truly exemplary in its seamless integration of deep historical insight and subtle philosophical argumentation... What strikes the contemporary reader upon reading these essays, besides their remarkable erudition and scholarly depth, is how pertinent they continue to be half a century after they were written. The epistemological lessons that Canguilhem draws from his detailed excursions into the history of biology resonate strongly with the current philosophy of biology agenda. Moving beyond its traditional concern with evolutionary biology, and with population genetics in particular, Anglophone philosophy of biology is increasingly engaging with areas of biological inquiry specifically concerned with the constitution and organization of living systems. In this context, Canguilhem&#x2019;s plea for the autonomy of biological method as well as biological theory has never been more relevant. Those who decide to pick up Knowledge of Life will find the writing dense, the arguments subtle, but the effort extremely worthwhile.

Haeckel lays out a strategy to create such a "sense-and-respond" approach that will allow companies to move quickly amid change. Among the key steps: companies must use innovative ways to gather information about customer needs. For instance, car manufacturers used video cameras in airport parking lots to discover that people often struggle to lift heavy suitcases over the high lower edges of trunks. In mall parking areas, the cameras revealed that shoppers had nowhere to put soft drinks they just bought. Now, low trunk edges and cupholders are standard features in almost every car. Because "sense-and-respond" is a relatively new business model formulated by Haeckel, the book is heavy on theory and slim on concrete examples. Nevertheless, <i>Adaptive Enterprise</i> has some good ideas for business leaders looking for an edge in a world where rapid change is the norm. <i>--Dan Ring</i>This is a soft-cover version of a book that has sold over 20,000 hard-cover copies to date. There is now a companion "<i>Adaptive Enterprise: The Workbook</i>," available on amazon.com that captures the lessons learned by--- and tools created for--- managers who have adopted and applied the prescriptions in this book since its publication.</p><h2>Stories of the Invisible: A Guided Tour of Molecules</h2><p>If atoms are letters, writes Philip Ball, then molecules are words. And through these words, scientists have uncovered many fascinating stories of the physical world. In <em>Stories of the Invisible</em>, Ball has compiled a cornucopia of tales spun by these intriguing, invisible words.<br> The book takes us on a tour of a world few of us knew existed. The author describes the remarkable molecular structure of spider's silk--a material that is pound for pound much stronger than steel--and shows how the Kevlar fibers in bulletproof vests were invented by imitating the alignment of molecules found in the spider's amazing thread. We also learn about the protein molecules that create movement, without which bacteria would be immobile, cells could not divide, there would be no reproduction and therefore no life.<br> Today we can invent molecules that can cure viral infections, store information, or help hold bridges together. But more importantly, Ball provides a fresh perspective on the future of molecular science, revealing how researchers are promising to reinvent chemistry as the central creative science of the 21st century.</p><p>"Molecules," Philip Ball writes, "are the smallest units of meaning in chemistry," the words, if you will, made up of atomic letters. In this lively essay, full of such useful metaphors, Ball shares his longstanding fascination with the unseen world once again, explaining some of the issues that guide modern biochemistry.<p> Consider a sheep, Ball offers, a congeries of "millions of little bits of sheepness." That animal is a blend of molecules, tens of thousands of varieties of them, many of them found in the grass, sky, and water that make up the sheep's environment, many of them shared with other animals and humans. It has been the task of modern chemistry to dissect matter, to tease out underlying structures and commonalities--and, Ball adds, to learn how to make of its constituent elements things that do things, "such as cure viral infections or store information or hold bridges together." How chemistry has done so, making body armor of spider silk and modeling computer networks on "molecular logic," drives Ball's discursive, entertaining, and eminently practical survey.</p><p> A trustworthy explainer of scientific matters to lay readers, Ball writes with clarity and grace--and the more difficult the concept, the better he gets. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Philip Ball</strong> is a science writer and consultant editor for <em>Nature</em>.

Both recipes and quilts preserve the culture and history of a people and their social, historic, and artistic connections to their past and their future. Celebrating both these traditions, <i>The Black Family Dinner Quilt</i> offers recipes based on both traditional and contemporary African-American cuisine with recipes full of down-home flavor but lower in fat, salt, and sugar.

Cummings (New York City)</b> </p><p> The focus of this quilt was the memory of my grandmother standing on her front porch waving goodbye. Standing on the porch she would be surrounded by her flowers that she cared for on a daily basis. In the back of her house there were vegetables and chickens. This farming tradition was brought with her from Georgia, having been raised on a farm. In her last years, I remember her always walking her company to the door and usually in her housecoat. She would stand tall and proud waving goodbye. The housecoat in the quilt is the very same one worn by my grandmother.<br> <b>Michael A. Cummings </b></p><p><b> Quilts are an ancient art form.

They are familiar, yet they are still art. </b></p><p><b> The African-American quilting tradition was brought to this country with the enslaved African bondsmen and women. They came here with the knowledge of complicated needlework skills such as patchwork piecing, embroidery and applique.

This concise history of the Catholic Church tells the story of the two thousand-year relationship between Jesus and the believers who have followed him. It is a story of people: peasants and popes, saints and heretics, martyrs and apostates. Mostly, the story shows how common people throughout the ages have passed on the faith from generation to generation and tried to live the life of Christ. So the story of the Church is also about the Spirit of God who dwells with us always. A Popular History of the Catholic Church offers the reader fifteen timelines, six maps, sixteen pages of full-color Christian art, questions for personal reflection or group discussion at the end of each chapter, and a subject index</p><p></p><h2>How to Cheat in Maya 2012: Tools and Techniques for Character Animation</h2><p><p>The Maya guide for animators, <i>How to Cheat in Maya 2012</i> presents everything you need to know about character animation in Maya.

Contemplative prayer, far from being the prerogative of a professional elite, is the fullness of Christian living for anyone. It can completely transform the lives of those who are prepared to take it all the way. Without spending much time on technical distinctions, Marked for Life speaks of the experience of prayer among ordinary people and the Easter experience in the New Testament.

In this book leading experts on the Great War provide a wide-ranging view of this war&#39;s causes, character, and legacy and show how it provides an essential framework for understanding the entire twentieth century.</p><p>Jay Winter is reader in modern history at Cambridge University. Geoffrey Parker is professor of history at Ohio State University. Mary R. Habeck is assistant professor of history at Yale University.Despite the passage of eight decades, there are numerous unresolved historical controversies regarding World War I; they include disputes over causes, conducts, and the legacy of the conflict. This anthology of essays does not "settle" these controversies; rather^B, it illuminates them. Michael Howard goes against the current grain by asserting both the political and moral necessity for the Allied victory. William C. Fuller suggests that a German victory could have prevented the rise of both Nazism and Bolshevism. Leonard V. Smith offers some intriguing insights into the mindset of mutinous soldiers in the trenches.

But what does it mean to design a classroom so that understanding is the primary objective? What would a system of instruction look like if we took seriously the goal of helping all students understand mathematics?</p> <p>In this ground-breaking book, James Hiebert and his colleagues arm teachers with the best current research-based ideas for designing - and defending - classrooms that support students' mathematical understanding. It is based on the authors' work in four separate research programs, all of which investigated the effects of specific instructional approaches. Out of their ongoing discussions emerged a striking consensus about what features are essential and what features are optional, which they share in this book. They also provide glimpses into their individual projects and into the classrooms from which they have drawn many of their ideas. </p> <p>By describing the essential features of classrooms that support students' mathematical understanding and by offering pictures of several classrooms that exhibit these features, <i>Making Sense</i> provides a valuable framework within which elementary teachers can reflect on their own practice and think again about what it means to teach for understanding. </p></p><p><p>Thomas Carpenter was Professor Emeritus of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he taught for twenty-five years.

On the Latin-English side all long vowels are shown by placing a -above them. Latin nouns show the genitive singular form in bold. Latin verbs show the first person singular of the present indicative as the headword, followed by the infinitive, the first person singular of the perfect indicative and usually the past participle, all in bold type:</p> <p><b>elegia, -ae<br>elementum, -i<br>elevo, are<br>ematuresco, -escere, -ui<br></b></p> <p><b>Part of Speech</b></p> <p>Next comes the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective etc), shown in italics. Part of speech abbreviations used in the dictionary are shown in the abbreviations list (p vii). Where a word has more than one part of speech, each new part of speech is preceded by a black lozenge (*). If a Latin headword is a preposition, the case taken by the preposition comes immediately after the part of speech, in italics and in brackets.</p> <p><b>era, -ae</b> f <br><b>ticklish</b> adj <br><b>thunder</b> <i>n</i> tonitrus <i>m</i> * <i>vi</i> tonare, intonare. <br><b>erga</b><i> prep (with acc)</i> towards; against.<br></p> <p><b>Meanings</b></p> <p>Where a word or a part of speech has only one meaning, the translation comes immediately after the part of speech. However, many words have more than one meaning. Where the context is likely to show which translation is correct, variations in meaning are simply separated by a semi-colon. But usually there will also be an "indicator" in <i>italics </i>and in brackets. Some meanings relate to specific subject areas, for example religion, politics, military matters etc -these indicators are in small italic capitals.</p> <p><b>ensiger, -i</b><i> adj</i> with his sword. <br><b>toy</b><i> n</i> crepundia <i>ntpl</i> * <i>vi</i> ludere. <br><b>toll collector </b><i>n</i> exactor <i>m</i>; portitor <i>m</i>.<br> <b>eo, -ire, ivi </b><i>and</i><b> ii, itum</b> <i>vi</i> to go; (<i>MIL</i>) to march; (<i>time</i>) to pass; (<i>event</i>) to proceed, turn out.<br></p> <p><b>Translations</b>Most words can be translated directly. On the English-Latin side, I translations of nouns include the gender of the Latin noun in <i>italics</i>. However, sometimes a phrase is needed to show how aword is used, but in some cases a direct translation of a phrasewould be meaningless: the symbol ~ in front of a translationshows that the translation is natural English, but does not meanword for word what the Latin means. Sometimes, even anapproximate translation would not be very helpful (for placenames, for example) -- in these cases, an explanation in <i>italics </i>isgiven instead. In other cases, the user will need more informa-tion than simply the translation; in these cases, "indicators" areincluded in the translation(s), giving, for instance, the caserequired by a Latin verb or preposition or further details about aplace or person.</p> <p><b>thumb</b><i> n</i> pollex<i> m</i>;<b> have under one's ~</b> in potestate sua habere. <br><b>elephantomacha, -ae</b> <i>m fighter mounted on an elephant.</i><br><b>Erymanthus, -i</b> <i>m</i> mountain range in Arcadia (<i>where Hercules killed the bear</i>).<br> <b>thwart</b> <i>vt</i> obstare (<i>dat</i>), officere (<i>lot</i>).<br></p> <p><b>Pronunciation</b></p> <p>Since Latin pronunciation is regular, once the basic rules have been learned (<i>see pp xi-xiii</i>), the dictionary does not show phonetic transcriptions against each headword, but does show all long vowels.</p> <p><b>Other Information</b></p> <p>The dictionary also includes: a basic grammar section information about life in Roman times:<br> -- how numbers and dates were calculated and expressed -- geographical names -- key events in Roman history -- (<i>important historical and mythological characters and events are listed within the body of the main text</i>). a section on Latin poetry and scansion</p></p><h2>Manhattan Love Song</h2><p><p>"Nothing beats a tale of fatalistic dread by the supreme master of suspense, Cornell Woolrich. His novels and hundreds of short stories define the essence of noir nihilism."-Marilyn Stasio, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p> <p>The father of modern noir first wanted to be the second F. Scott Fitzgerald. This 1932 novel brilliantly showcases Cornell Woolrich's transition from modernist to pulp master, as the reader follows a young Manhattan couples' tragic fall from grace.</p> <p><b>Cornell Woolrich</b> reinvented suspense fiction for the twentieth century. For four decades hundreds of his stories appeared in popular American pulp magazines while motion picture directors as varied as Hitchcock and Truffaut memorably translated his work into such classic suspense films as <i>Rear Window</i> and <i>The Bride Wore Black</i>. He died, alone in a Manhattan hotel room, in 1968.</p></p><p>From the 1930s until his death in 1968, Cornell Woolrich riveted the reading public with his unparalled mystery, suspense, and horror stories. Classic films like Hitchcock&#39;s Rear Window and Trauffaut&#39;s The Bride Wore Black and novels like Night has a Thousand Eyes and Rendezvous in Black earned Woolrich epithets like &#34;the twentieth century&#39;s Edgar Allen Poe&#34; and &#34;the father of noir.&#34;This 1932 novel presages Woolrich's emergence as a noir star, and it finds him exploring suitably dark relationship themes. Blow past unhappily married narrator Wade's melodramatic first encounter with mobbed-up party girl Bernice Pascal on the pre-Depression Manhattan streets, and the story soon settles into a snappy Jazz Age essay of the many crimes lonely, deluded hearts willingly commit. Although Wade's sardonic jibes and cocky narcissism feel downright contemporary as he obsessively pursues his dangerous dame, Woolrich displays classic descriptive gifts when showing readers a moon looming "like a gilt thumbtack nailing the blue plush carpet that was the sky closer to the floor of heaven," and later, "a natty fellow who looked as though he'd had his clothes poured over him hot, and then allowed to harden." In a new introduction, Francis M. Nevins contends the novel "meant so much to [Woolrich] that he resurrected elements from it several times during his later career." Even if this is a minor work, noir fans will find plenty in it to enjoy. <i>Frank Sennett</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p><h2>D. H.

Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s This Side of Paradise is the opening statement of his literary career. Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy decade that was to follow in America. This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald simultaneously famous and infamous: famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing and infamous for the errors--in spelling, fact, grammar, and chronology--that peppered his text. This new edition brings into being an accurate, fully annotated text based on Fitzgerald&#39;s original manuscript.</p><h2>Journey into Social Activism: Qualitative Approaches (Donald McGannon Communication Research Center&#39;s Everett C. Parker Book Series)</h2><p><p>Academic study of social activism and social movements has become increasingly prevalent over the years; this is due in large part to the fact that activists have captured public imagination and gained substantial influence in political discourse. For instance, Occupy Wall Street activists, Tea Party activists, and activists affiliated with the Arab Spring have transformed political debates and have become the focus of mainstream news media coverage about a variety of different political topics.</p><p>Journey into Social Activism explicates the philosophical foundations of the study of activism and illustrates four different research sites in which activism can be observed and studied: organizations, networks, events, and alternative media. The book will introduce students and scholars to important qualitative approaches to the study of social activism within these four research sites, which is based entirely on successful research projects that have been conducted and published in recent years. Ultimately, this book will prove integral to any students and scholars who wish to use qualitative methods for their research endeavors concerning social<br>activism in contemporary society.</p></p><p>Joshua Atkinson is an Associate Professor in the School of Media &amp; Communication at Bowling Green State University.Atkinson casts a wide net in reviewing methods for studying activism in this unique book, and in fact he ends up going far beyond research methods to help us understand how social movements work and why they are so important. He is very good at raising provocative questions. (&#x2015;James M. Jasper <i>CUNY Graduate Center, author of The Art of Moral Protest</i>)</p><h2>The Protective Shell in Children and Adults</h2><p>This book is by a professional for other professionals, but thoughtful people who are interested in the fundamental aspects of human nature will also find much to interest them. The papers which have been published in various journals or delivered to professional audiences since the appearance of Frances Tustin&#39;s previous book Autistic Barriers in Neurotic Patients are integrated with unpublished material written especially for this book, so that they can enrich and illuminate each other. A paper from the early days of her work with autistic children is the focus of this present work, since her awareness of encapsulation as being the major protective reaction associated with the autistic states of both psychotic and neurotic patients, has stemmed from that early paper.</p><p></p><h2>Creating Personal Presence: Look, Talk, Think, and Act Like a Leader</h2><p>Personal presence is difficult to define but easy to recognize. People with presence carry themselves in a way that turns heads. When they talk, people listen. When they ask, people answer. When they lead, people follow. Personal presence can help you get a date, a mate, a job, or a sale. It can help you lead a meeting, a movement, or an organization.<br><br> Presence is not something you&#x2019;re born with&#x2014;anyone can learn these skills, habits, and traits. Award-winning speaker and consultant Dianna Booher shows how to master dozens of small and significant things that work together to convey presence. She details how body language, manners, and even your surroundings enhance credibility and build rapport. You&#x2019;ll learn to use voice and language to demonstrate competence, deliver clear and memorable messages, and master emotions. You&#x2019;ll learn to think strategically, organize ideas coherently, and convey to others genuine interest, integrity, respect, and reliability. <br><br> Take her self-assessment to measure your progress. With Dianna Booher&#x2019;s expert, entertaining advice, you can have the same kind of influence as the most successful CEOs, celebrities, and civic leaders.</p><p>Dianna Booher is CEO of Booher Consultants, serving Fortune 500 clients such as IBM, PepsiCo, USAA, and JPMorgan Chase.

I put in the hours. On performance reviews, my director has given me the highest marks for attitude, legal competence, that sort of thing. But I&#x2019;m just not getting the opportunities to network and deal with clients to bring in the business. Sure, I&#x2019;m on the &#x2018;team,&#x2019; but I&#x2019;m never the lead counsel. That&#x2019;s what you have to do to make partner&#x2014;bring in the business. And if I don&#x2019;t make partner in the next year or two, I&#x2019;m out.&#x201d;<br><br> She paused reflectively before concluding, &#x201c;Most all the partners in the firm are male. Whether intentional or not, I really think there&#x2019;s a bias there that&#x2019;s keeping me from getting in front of clients. It just has to be the gender thing.&#x201d;<br><br> It was not the gender thing.<br><br> The senior partner of the law firm had called a week earlier with his feedback on Lydia and his goals for our coaching session together. The upshot of his call was this: &#x201c;Lydia&#x2019;s very competent legally. And she&#x2019;s very willing to put in the hours. But to date, we&#x2019;ve been hesitant to put her in front of our clients or in the courtroom. I can&#x2019;t put my finger on what it is exactly, but she just lacks presence and polish. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m hoping you can accomplish with her.&#x201d;<br><br> He proceeded to describe several symptoms, including this particular comment that stands out in my memory: &#x201c;Even the way she introduces herself when she and the team meet clients or prospects for the first time minimizes her experience and our expertise as a firm. I&#x2019;ve tried to give her a few pointers myself, but she doesn&#x2019;t take feedback well.&#x201d;<br><br> Although dressed in a business suit as typical for her profession, Lydia arrived looking at least a decade out of step. In addition to the cold-fish handshake, her energy level seemed no higher than thirty watts. Her voice, too, lacked intensity. A permanent furrow seemed etched across her forehead. As I introduced her to others on my staff, she had difficulty chatting with them as they gathered for morning coffee. When I asked about interactions with clients and other executives in the firm, she rambled and lacked a strategic focus about the organization&#x2019;s goals. To most of my suggestions, her responses were &#x201c;yes, but ...&#x201d; followed by a justification.<br><br> The first few minutes into our coaching session, I arrived at the same conclusion as her boss: Lydia lacked presence, and unfortunately for her future with the firm, she didn&#x2019;t take feedback well. Typically when clients leave a coaching session, they comment on how they plan to put the new skills and ideas into practice and promise to call back with the results.<br><br> I never heard from Lydia again.<br><br> On the other hand, Jon, CEO of a major aerospace defense contractor, profited handsomely from feedback. At the end of one of our coaching sessions, Jon said to me, &#x201c;Okay, so tell me how to dress. I&#x2019;m an engineer and I don&#x2019;t usually pay attention to that sort of thing. I&#x2019;m divorced. Don&#x2019;t have a wife to give me opinions anymore. But I know it&#x2019;s important. And Kathryn, our VP of Communications, told me I need to get your opinion on dress for my first all-hands meeting and my speech for the conference in Germany. Colors? Button jacket or leave it open?&#x201d;<br><br> We worked on his opening, a personal anecdote, for the all-hands speech for almost two hours, because his goal was to set the tone for the new direction for the company and inspire confidence in his ability to chart that new course.<br><br> Seemingly small things can make a big impact.<br><br> The &#x201c;little&#x201d; things can make a big difference in landing a job, getting a promotion, winning a contract, or leading an organization through change&#x2014;as Jon, the new CEO, understood in successfully leading his organization to regain its position as industry leader. He won the hearts and minds of his organization with his first &#x201c;state of the organization&#x201d; speech to employees after assuming his office.<br><br> For the next six months as I was in and out of the organization, other executives commented on Jon as if he&#x2019;d become a celebrity after his debut address. He had developed presence, and it had a huge impact&#x2014;on him and his organization.<br><br> Personal presence may be difficult to define, but we all know it when we see it. Someone walks into the room and people step aside. Heads turn. Conversation opens up to include them. When they speak, people applaud or chime in. When they ask, people answer. When they lead, people follow. When they leave, things wind down.<br><br> People with presence look confident and comfortable, speak clearly and persuasively, think clearly even under pressure. They act with intention. People with presence reflect on their emotions, attitudes, and situations and then adapt. They accept responsibility for themselves and the results they achieve. People with presence are real. They present their genuine character authentically. What they say and do matches who they are.<br><br> Mother Teresa was as welcome and comfortable in the world&#x2019;s boardrooms as the most articulate CEO, the best-dressed movie star, or high-earning sports celebrity. At just five feet tall, dressed in her traditional habit, with few earthly possessions to call her own, Mother Teresa had at least one secret that many imitators lack. And unfortunately, this one&#x2014;or its absence&#x2014;takes a while to surface: character.<br><br> For forty-five years, armed with little but her integrity, her tongue, and her ability to make CEOs feel the plight of the poor, Mother Teresa persuaded them to finance her goals: orphanages, hospices, leper houses, hospitals, and soup kitchens. By the time of her death, 123 countries on six continents had felt her personal presence.<br><br> Presence can help you get a date, a mate, or a sale. Presence can help you lead a meeting, a movement, a revolution, or a nation. Presence appears in all segments of society and all levels of an organization.<br><br> Presence may be used for noble purposes or selfish goals. When politicians, athletes, movie stars, or managers slip into crass or manipulative behavior, we boycott their events, bad-mouth their leadership, and say they have no class.<br><br> Wherever you are and wherever you want to go, presence can help you get there.<br><br> I&#x2019;m convinced that Mother Teresa had studied Aristotle. Back in the fourth century, he identified three essentials of persuasive communication&#x2014;another big component of personal presence:<br><br> &#x2014;logical argument (the ability to articulate your points clearly)<br><br> &#x2014;emotion (the ability to create or control emotion in your listeners)<br><br> &#x2014;character (the ability to convey integrity and goodwill)<br><br> Times haven&#x2019;t changed all that much. Being a skilled communicator&#x2014;a huge part of personal presence&#x2014;still grants social status and influence. In fact, communication makes leadership possible&#x2014;in politics, in the community, in the workplace, in the family. Think how often pundits and voters alike point out a candidate&#x2019;s speaking ability and social skills&#x2014;or lack thereof. Not only do we expect our presidents and celebrities to speak well, but also that has become the expected norm for CEOs, system analysts, sales professionals, and soccer moms.<br><br> As I mentioned in the Preface, you can never measure presence in the same sense that you can measure someone&#x2019;s heart rate or their running speed. Measuring someone&#x2019;s presence falls more along the lines of measuring their health. Generally, physicians can check reflexes, do an EKG, give a stress test, check cholesterol levels, do a blood and urine analysis, give a vision and hearing exam, and then certify that someone is free of disease and physically fit or unfit. Beyond that baseline of health, subjectivity comes into play. Individuals compete among themselves and against their own personal standards for healthy living according to the energy levels they want and lifestyles they want to lead.<br><br> But there are substantive core concepts involved at some point as well as subjectivity.<br><br> The same holds true for personal presence. This book aims to capture these core concepts about presence. Beyond these, what you see and hear comes down to others&#x2019; perception of your presence. The book will also delve into the subjective realm&#x2014;what affects others&#x2019; subjective perceptions about your presence and credibility.<br><br> At work, the limiting label generally comes down to some supervisor&#x2019;s statement on a performance appraisal or around a conference room table that the person under discussion lacks &#x201c;polish.&#x201d;<br><br> Often we hear entire groups of rising superstars in an organization categorized and set aside for special mentoring or training this way: &#x201c;These are the high potentials. We&#x2019;ve identified them early on for key projects and high-visibility assignments in front of the executive team. We need you to help them add the finishing touches.&#x201d;<br><br> Although they are technically competent, someone at the top has decided that they need more presence to make the next career jump. Certain commonalities always surface&#x2014;common traits and attitudes among the candidates, as well as similar remarks from the executives sending them for the coaching.<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Brilliant. But not well liked. Just doesn&#x2019;t connect with people.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t always use the appropriate language&#x2014;too flippant, too laid back.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Too stiff, always looks a little nervous, with that deer-in-the-headlights look.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Comes on too strong. Needs to dial it back.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t dress appropriately. Just not what I call classy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Rambles. Knows her stuff, but gets off track and down in the weeds too easily.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Tentative. Needs confidence.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Too intense.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;&#x201c;Has difficulty facilitating a meeting with a lot of strong personalities in the room.&#x201d;<br><br> Whatever the comment, the superstar has hit a wall for a reason, and he or she has no idea what it is or how to &#x201c;fix it.&#x201d; Most people are aware, however, of the advantages increased presence brings them. They understand that influence demands personal presence.<br><br> This special categorization of &#x201c;high potential&#x201d; and help has been offered, not because this group of individuals ranks low on the continuum of personal presence. Exactly the opposite. They get tagged for &#x201c;polish&#x201d; because they already rank high on that continuum of presence and have shown excellent skills, potential, commitment, and interest in increasing their influence and impact to an even greater degree in the organization.<br><br> Presence is not an all-or-nothing commodity. Consider a continuum or a funnel such as you see in the chart below, with your physical attributes, natural talents, communication skills, and character traits plotted along the way somewhere from one end to the other between &#x201c;low presence/low impact&#x201d; and &#x201c;high presence/ high impact.&#x201d; All of us can inch a little closer to the high end every day as we present ourselves with awareness and intention.<br><br> Booher Consultants surveyed more than two hundred professionals across multiple industries to ask respondents their reasons for wanting to increase their personal presence. Forty-eight percent responded that their reason was either to &#x201c;increase credibility in the organization&#x201d; or &#x201c;sell my ideas and projects.&#x201d; Our consultants have been hearing the same reasons for the past thirty years as they&#x2019;ve coached individual clients.<br><br> Our survey asked this question: &#x201c;In general, how much does someone&#x2019;s personal presence affect how much credibility they have with you?&#x201d; &#x201c;A great deal&#x201d; was the response from 74.5 percent of the survey participants.<br><br> So how do you make sure that you develop that certain mystique of personal presence?<br><br> Understand that there really is no mystery after all. This book picks up the baton where Aristotle left it: Becoming a persuasive communicator leads to credibility and influence. And you can develop those skills and attributes. You can have the same effect as CEOs, celebrities, civic leaders, and any influential individual if you develop your personal presence to its greatest impact.<br><br> The following chapters will provide practical tips and techniques that will help you connect with others and communicate with credibility, power, and significance. You&#x2019;ve heard it said that someone has &#x201c;the presence of mind&#x201d; to do X. Likewise, this book covers the mental, physical, and emotional aspects of presence. To put it simply, your personal presence involves how you:<br><br> &#x2014;look (your body language, handshake, movement, dress, surroundings)<br><br> &#x2014;talk (the words you choose, the physical qualities of your voice, how you use your voice)<br><br> &#x2014;think and communicate your thoughts (how you organize ideas and information, what you decide to pass on or withhold, how you frame issues)<br><br> &#x2014;act (the attitudes, values, and competence your actions reveal)<br><br> As you increase your personal presence, you will strengthen your credibility and expand your influence. With that stronger impact, you&#x2019;ll increase your chances of achieving your personal and career goals and the mission and goals of your organization.<br><br> PERSONAL PRESENCE<br><br> Your character serves as the foundation of the funnel. But your appearance is typically what others observe first about you. As you develop your presence in all four areas, you will increase your impact.<br><br> Specifically, you&#x2019;ll learn to:<br><br> � Think on your feet under pressure as you state opinions and answer questions.<br><br> � Cut through the clutter and communicate issues clearly in ways that engage others both intellectually and emotionally.<br><br> � Win others&#x2019; trust by identifying specific steps to demonstrate your integrity and goodwill.<br><br> � Use your body language to build rapport and connect with an audience, an executive team, your staff, a prospective employer, and your clients.<br><br> � Eliminate body language that undermines your credibility and sabotages your success.<br><br> � Use your voice and language to demonstrate competence and calm rather than incompetence and stress.<br><br> � Position yourself as a thought leader with a strategic perspective.<br><br> No matter where each of us is on the continuum of personal presence, we can all improve. Personal presence is about developing your communication skills, thinking skills, and character to influence others for good and help you achieve your goals in life.</p><h2>Living Bliss: Major Discoveries Along the Holistic Path</h2><p>Almost a century of research has shown that the most conscientious individuals enjoy longer and healthier lives. The crucial feature of conscientiousness is being organized and responsible, which are the traits that contribute most to society in general. Unfortunately, some individuals fail to achieve their greatest potential because they did not establish the nurturing, bonding system that is most essential for health, happiness, and success. In this book, you will find the tools to optimize your self-esteem, health, and longevity.In the 1960s, the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) took acupuncture to a new level, revolutionizing pain management. Now the most important acupuncture advancement in 4,000 years is the activation of the hormone oxytocin without needles or electrical stimulation. By using essential oils on acupuncture points, you will create the "bliss" that enables you to fulfill your potential for conscientious living.Based on research of the past two decades, it is now possible for you to activate five specific acupuncture circuits. Using this method, you will: �Restore dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the most important health-enhancing hormone �Boost your calcitonin, the essential thyroid hormone for maintaining bone strength and reducing pain �Reduce free radicals, the scavengers that essentially wear out or "rust" your body �Balance your aldosterone, the adrenal hormone responsible for water and potassium health �Activate your crucial bonding, nurturing hormone&#x2014;oxytocin&#x2014;the ultimate bliss hormone! Using specific blends of natural essential oils, you can do your own transcutaneous acupuncture&#x2014;with no needles and in only 30 seconds!This is a powerful path to conscientious living that enables you to live a longer, healthier, and happier life&#x2014;helping yourself, and, as a result, helping others.</p><p>C.

Over those years, I have interviewed Norm for a number of magazines and for inclusion in my books. I have followed his research in pain clinics and in the examination of healers such as Henry Rucker and Olga Worrall.

Now, in this remarkable book, Dr. Shealy shares his passions, enthusiasms, and goals, and he challenges his readers to achieve their own betterment. With complete openness, he discloses the guidance of his angelic teacher and the inspiration that he has gained from glimpses into his past lives.

Dreiser&#x2019;s account of his homecoming will touch a familiar and responsive chord in anyone who has undertaken one.... In that, as in so much else in this book, as in the great body of all his work, Dreiser in his earnest, heartfelt, clumsy way speaks to the universal experience." &#x2015;Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>"Because [the book] provides a portrait of the artist as a young man and describes the nation as a mosaic of individual cultures, Dreiser&#x2019;s journey offers several different lessons. Part travelogue, part autobiography, part collection of essays, A Hoosier Holiday lays out the landscape of a nation that ceased to exist once the highway unfurled across the map." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></p><p>By 1914, Theodore Dreiser was a successful writer living in New York. He had not been back to his home state in over 20 years. When his friend Franklin Booth approached him with the idea of driving from New York to Indiana, Dreiser&#x2019;s response to Booth was immediate: "All my life I&#x2019;ve been thinking of making a return trip to Indiana and writing a book about it." Along the route, Dreiser recorded his impressions of the people and land in words while his traveling companion sketched some of these scenes. In this reflective tale, Dreiser and Booth cross four states to arrive at Indiana and the sites and memories of Dreiser&#x2019;s early life in Terre Haute, Sullivan, Evansville, Warsaw, and his one year at Indiana University.</p></p><p>A Selection of The Reader&#x2019;s SubscriptionBy 1914, Theodore Dreiser was a successful writer with an international reputation, as well as a fixture on the New York literary scene. He had not been back to Indiana, his home state, in over twenty years when he was approached by his friend Franklin Booth, a respected and very successful artist, to make the trip together by automobile. The result is a narrative brimming with detail and the first modern work of American road literature, capturing the euphoric freedom to be found behind the wheel of a car.</p><h2>Discovering the Universe</h2><p><i>Discovering the Universe</i> is the bestselling brief text for descriptive one-term astronomy courses (especially those with no mathematics prerequisites).

A growing number of scholars and political activists have invoked the term to describe a variety of changing economic, political, cultural, ideological, and environmental processes that are alleged to have accelerated in the last few decades. Rather than forcing such a complex social phenomenon into a single conceptual framework, Manfred Steger presents globalization in plain, readable English as a multifaceted process encompassing global, regional, and local aspects of social life. In addition to explaining the various dimensions of globalization, the author explores whether globalization should be considered a &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34; thing--a question that has been hotly debated in classrooms, boardrooms, and on the streets.</p><p><br><strong>Manfred B.

Why do we suddenly change for the better after years of failed efforts? Why do some of us never escape our self-destructive behaviors, even when we desperately want to? What is it that most reliably and effectively produces growth, learning, and development that persist over time?<br><br>In this vividly written volume, psychotherapist Jeffrey Kottler weaves together inspiring stories and the latest research, taking the reader on a fascinating exploration of human behavior while highlighting what does--and does not--lead to lasting change. Kottler illuminates our many efforts to change--to stop taking drugs, reduce dependencies, leave a destructive relationship, find new and more meaningful work, or adjust to a devastating accident or trauma. Readers are invited to explore key triggers such as hitting bottom, moments of clarity, the power of altruism and service, travel to new surroundings, reading or listening to stories, religious conversion, and much more. Kottler also explores why most changes don't last and what we can do to prevent relapses.<br><br>Throughout the book, Kottler recounts stories of colleagues and patients--and even recalls episodes from his own life-often moving tales of remarkable, unexpected, and lasting transformation. He looks, for instance, at a young black basketball star, confined to a wheelchair for life after being shot four times, who turned his life around, becoming a scholar and a PhD. <br><br>An intriguing glimpse into the complexity of the human psyche, <em>Change</em> will engage anyone who has ever struggled to alter a habit, enrich relationships, recover from disappointment or failure, strive for more meaningful and productive work, deal with anxiety, loneliness, fears, stress, and depression, or transform their lives in any kind of significant way.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeffrey A. Kottler</strong> is one of the foremost authorities and prolific writers in the fields of counseling, psychology, and education. He is the best-selling author of more than 80 nonfiction books that deal with a wide range of subjects, including a variety of contemporary issues related to helping and healing, truth and lies, creativity, transformative travel, and stress management. He is Professor of Counseling at California State University, Fullerton, and President of Empower Nepali Girls, an organization that provides scholarships for at-risk children in Nepal.<br>I was pretty impressed with this book. ... this is an extremely comprehensive work on many aspects of transformation, aiming to show how life changes can be made in many areas of behaviour and environment. It is wonderfully enhanced by a multiplicity of inspirational examples both from Kottler&#39;s personal experience (including, for instance, a very touching reference to the death of his mother) and from the hundreds of people he has interviewed and treated within a wide variety of backgrounds. * Terry Goodwin, New Nurturing Potential *</p><h2>CompTIA Mobility+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide (Exam MB0-001)</h2><p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>A new exam guide for the new certification on mobile computing technologies from CompTIA</b></p><p>Prepare for CompTIA Mobility+ exam MB0-001 with McGraw-Hill Professional&#x2015;a Platinum-Level CompTIA Authorized Partner offering Authorized CompTIA Approved Quality Content to give you the competitive edge on exam day.</p><p>Get complete coverage of all objectives for CompTIA Mobility+ exam MB0-001 from this comprehensive resource.

This book ranges from the concrete details of conducting raids, battles and sieges to more theoretical questions about the causes, costs, and consequences of warfare in archaic and classical Greece. It argues that the Greek sources present a highly selective and idealised picture, too easily accepted by most modern scholars, and that a more critical study of the evidence leads to radically different conclusions about the Greek way of war.</p></p><p><p><b>Hans van Wees</b> is Reader in Ancient History at University College London.

In it he found the missing pieces of this short but trenchant complement to Pessoa's major prose work, <i>The Book of Disquiet</i>. Pessoa himself noted that despite their dialectical differences, the middle-class author of <i>The Book of Disquiet</i> (assistant bookkeeper Bernardo Soares) and the aristocrat Teive, &#x201c;are two instances of the very same phenomenon--an inability to adapt to real life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are in Pessoa echoes of Beckett's exquisite boredom; the dark imaginings of Baudelaire (whom he loved); Melville's evasive confidence man; the dreamscapes of Borges&#x201d; --<i>Voice Literary Supplement</i><br><br>&#x201c;The humorist who never smiles and makes our blood run cold, the inventor of other poets and self-destroyer, the author of paradoxes clear as water, and like water, dizzying, the mysterious one who doesn't cultivate mystery, mysterious as the moon at noon, the taciturn ghost of the Portuguese midday--who is Pessoa?&#x201d; --Octavio Paz</p><p>Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935) published little in his lifetime, but his rediscovery in the 1990s has been as central to postmodernism as the rediscovery of Kafka in the 1950s was to modernism. <i>The Book of Disquiet</i> is now widely regarded as a classic, and has been translated into nearly every European language.</p><h2>The Student&#39;s Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience</h2><p><p>Reflecting recent changes in the way cognition and the brain are studied, this book provides a comprehensive and student-friendly guide to cognitive neuroscience.

"Time management" techniques treat these symptoms by making our busyness more efficient, but not the underlying cause. Needleman shows that we can get more out of time by breaking free of our illusions about it. He helps us experience time more purposefully and meaningfully. He provides parables, reflections, and a unique mental exercise to give us a new understanding of time. By transforming the way we understand and experience time, this powerful book gives us the equanimity and perspective we need to make the most of the time we are given. "A tranquil heart," Needleman writes,"is never defeated by time."</p><p>Jacob Needleman is Professor of Philosophy at San Francisco State University, former visiting professor at Duxx Graduate School of Business Leadership in Monterrey, Mexico, and former Director of the Center for the Study of New Religions at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.

It calls to us from the deepest recesses of the human heart. And it bedevils us on all the surfaces of our everyday life. At the deeper levels, in front of the mystery of time, we are mortal beings solemnly aware of our finitude&#x2014;longing, perhaps, for that in ourselves which partakes of the eternal. But at the surface levels of ourselves, in front of the problem of time, we are like frantic puppets trying to manage the influences of the past, the threats and promises of the future and the tense demands of the ever-diminishing present moment. The mystery of time has the power to call us quietly back to ourselves and toward our essential freedom and humanness. The problem of time, on the other hand, agitates us and &#x201c;lays waste our powers.&#x201d;<br><br> 2<br><br> In 1997, when this book was first published, the uniquely modern form of the problem of time&#x2014;the astonishing fact that the conditions of contemporary life are bleeding meaningful time out of our lives&#x2014;had already begun to assume epidemic proportions. Almost all of us&#x2014;including even young children&#x2014;were being afflicted by this new poverty, this time-poverty. Awash in material goods, awash in new and ingenious forms of money and their ever-darkening shadow of debt, whipped faster and faster by advancing technology&#x2014;and all the while telling ourselves we were better off than ever before&#x2014;we began to realize, dimly at first, that we were no longer living our lives. We began to see that our lives were living us. And we began to suspect that our relationship to time had become so toxic precisely because we had forgotten how to bring to our day-to-day lives the essential question of who and what a human being is and is meant to be. We had lost touch with the mystery of time&#x2014;that is to say, the mystery of our humanness, our being, our life and death.<br><br> 3<br><br> This edition seeks to explore what it means to allow the mystery of time to irrigate our parched and driven lives. My fundamental premise is that the pathology of our relationship to time can be healed only as we allow ourselves to be penetrated by the mystery of what we are beneath the surface of ourselves&#x2014;by striving, that is, to remember our Selves. Both the content and the form of this book have been shaped by this intention and premise.<br><br> How is it that as we grow older time passes through our hands more and more rapidly? Who among us doesn&#x2019;t now and again longingly recall some sweet passages of time when we were young children&#x2014;the huge days and weeks of a summer, perhaps, or simply idle hours happily &#x201c;doing nothing&#x201d;? This sense that time is passing more and more quickly is, of course, a common human experience. But it may be that in our contemporary culture the speeding up&#x2014;and, hence, the vanishing&#x2014;of time has assumed uniquely frightening proportions. How often it happens that we come to the end of a day or a week or a month shaken by the realization of how quickly it is all going by! With a troubled, backward glance we wonder to ourselves: &#x201c;Where was I?&#x201d;<br><br> It is a very telling question and a very accurate clue to the problem of time in our personal lives&#x2014;and in the life of the modern world. Where was I? Where am I? In fact, I was not there, I am not present in my life; I do not inhabit my life. And one can imagine the chilling prospect even of coming to the end of one&#x2019;s days with the same bewildered, anguished cry: &#x201c;Where was I?&#x201d; Is my whole life somehow passing by without me? That is surely what it means to say that meaningful time is disappearing from our lives.<br><br> 4<br><br> We may say we wish for more time, for longer life, but this specific problem of the disappearance of meaningful time cannot be solved by having more time in a quantitative sense. A man or woman could live a hundred years, a thousand years, but if he or she was not there, not present in his or her life, it would come to the same thing at the end: &#x201c;Where was I?&#x201d;<br><br> It is precisely this question and this problem that has by now burrowed into the core of our whole civilization. The current of change in world affairs, in the patterns and mores of human culture, in the march of history and even in the biological and geological processes of planet earth seems to be accelerating in ways that are equally bewildering&#x2014;when they are not absolutely terrifying. The boundaries and leadership of nations and governments seem more and more fragile, in many regions rapidly falling and rising and falling again under who knows what influences and causes. In the sciences hardly a day goes by without fundamental assumptions about the natural world or the human body being challenged by one &#x201c;breakthrough&#x201d; after another, resulting in a disordered mix of hope, disappointment and pervasive moral confusion. And as for the practical applications of modern science, it is no exaggeration to say that the continuously accelerating influence of advanced technology is more and more rapidly changing nearly every pattern of human conduct in nearly every corner of the world and within nearly every culture and every tradition of the world: in family relations, in sexual morality, in the meaning and nature of work, in business, in religion, in the arts, in the nature of childhood and the instruments of education, in the self-concept and despair of the rising generation, in the meaning of love&#x2014;the list is endless. There is absolutely no corner or pocket of human life that is not changing with such acceleration as to induce a helpless numbing of our sensibilities&#x2014;or else an agitated and often divisive, piecemeal activism that remains equally helpless, beating out small fires while behind our backs an inferno of ever-accelerating change throws its thousand sparks over the whole of the world and the whole of our common life.<br><br> 5<br><br> But it is necessary to realize that technology itself is not the cause of our problem of time. Its influence on our lives is a result, not a cause&#x2014;the result of an unseen accelerating process taking place in ourselves, in our inner being. Whether we point to the effect of communication technology (such as e-mail) with its tyranny of instant communication; or to the computerization, and therefore the mentalization of so many human activities that previously required at least some participation of our physical presence; or to any of the other innumerable transformations of human life that are being brought about by the new technologies, the essential element to recognize is how much of what we call &#x201c;progress&#x201d; is accompanied by and measured by the fact that human beings need less and less conscious attention to perform their activities and lead their lives. The real power of the faculty of attention, unknown to modern science, is one of the indispensable and most central measures of humanness&#x2014;of the being of a man or a woman&#x2014;and has been so understood, in many forms and symbols, at the heart of all the great spiritual teachings of the world. The effects of advancing technology, for all the material promise they offer the world (along with the dangers, of course) is but the most recent wave in a civilization that, without recognizing what it was doing, has placed the satisfaction of desire above the cultivation of being. The deep meaning of many rules of conduct and moral principles of the past&#x2014; so many of which have been abandoned without our understanding their real roots in human nature&#x2014; involved the cultivation and development of the uniquely human power of attention, its action in the body, heart and mind of man. To be present, truly present, is to have conscious attention. This capacity is the key to what it means to be human.<br><br> 6<br><br> It is not, therefore, the rapidity of change as such that is the source of our problem of time. It is the metaphysical fact that the being of man is diminishing. In the world as in oneself, time is vanishing because we have lost the practice of consciously inhabiting our life, the practice of bringing conscious attention to ourselves as we go about our lives. All clich�s about &#x201c;be here, now&#x201d; aside, the fundamental fact is that, in ways we cannot imagine, the key to living the values we prize&#x2014;freedom, moral will, com- passion, common sense and far-seeing wisdom&#x2014;depend on the exercise and development of the uniquely human capacity to free our attention from its &#x201c;capture&#x201d; by the impulses of the body and the imaginings and automatisms of the mind and emotions. In the world as in oneself, everything depends of the presence of humanness&#x2014;in oneself it depends on the presence, even if only to a relative degree, of the Self, the real I am&#x2014;and in the life of the world it depends on the presence of people who have and can manifest this capacity to be, or even only who wish for it and who come together to learn from each other and to help each other for that purpose.<br><br> 7<br><br> To ask where are the people is to ask where is the soul of the whole of humanity? Where are the men and women of being and genuine honor? The metaphysical fact&#x2014;and such facts exist; they are properly called cosmic laws&#x2014;is that the vanishing of time in our lives is the result of the progressive diminishing of the inner life of people, not only our individual inner lives, but the inner life of humankind as a whole. Where are the people? That is, in the whole of contemporary life, where are the men and women who understand how to search for what is objectively good and true and who understand how to call the rest of us to that search and that way of life? Just as I am not present in my body and my life, so authentic humanness seems to be disappearing from the body and the life of humankind as a whole. Where are the people?<br><br> Some years ago I was walking in downtown San Francisco&#x2014;in the financial district&#x2014; with a great friend, a learned Tibetan scholar who was helping some colleagues and me translate one of the most beloved sacred texts of Tibetan Buddhism, The Life of Milarepa. My friend had lived a long time in North America and was a frequent visitor to the United States. He was a layman, married and a father; he did not hold religious office and was not materially supported by a religious community. He had to make his way in the same world as the rest of us; he wore neither the robes nor the social &#x201c;armor&#x201d; of a lama or guru. One sensed in him the depth of Asian wisdom uniquely joined to the raw experience of the conditions of modern, Western culture with all its shocks and temptations, all its psychological, social and financial pressures, its tempo, its brilliance and its darkness. He was outwardly and inwardly a man who lived in and between two worlds&#x2014;one an ancient, spiritually determined society and the other our own culture with its progressively diminishing understanding of the being of man.<br><br> 8<br><br> We were discussing the Buddhist idea of what it means to be a human. One of the most compelling expressions of the Buddhist notion of humanness concerns the rarity of the event of being born into the world in human form, in contrast to the other forms of existence that Buddhism recognizes: animals, plants, denizens of hell, &#x201c;gods,&#x201d; &#x201c;goddesses,&#x201d; &#x201c;angels&#x201d; and demons of all kinds. In the symbolic realism of the Tibetan tradition human beings occupy a uniquely central place in the whole cosmic scheme, precisely intermediate between the &#x201c;gods&#x201d; (who themselves are victims of &#x201c;higher&#x201d; illusions) and the ghosts and denizens of the lower worlds. In this central cosmic place, containing within himself all the impulses and forces of all the worlds, man alone has the possibility of working to escape from samsara, the endlessly turning cycle of illusion and suffering.<br><br> 9<br><br> I was asking my friend about one of the most striking ways that the Tibetans express the uniqueness of the human condition. Imagine, they say, that deep in the vast ocean there swims a great and ancient turtle who surfaces for air only once every hundred years. Imagine further that floating somewhere in the ocean is a single ox-yoke carried here and there by the random waves and currents. What are the chances that when the turtle surfaces, his head will happen to emerge precisely through the center of the ox-yoke? That is how rare it is to be born as a human being!<br><br> In the middle of our conversation, I pointed to the crowds of men and women rushing by on the street and I gestured in a way to indicate not only them, but all the thousands and millions of people rushing around in the world. &#x201c;Tell me, Lobsang,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;if it is so rare to be born a human being, how come there are so many people in the world?&#x201d;<br><br> My friend slowed his pace and then stopped. He waited for a moment, taking in my question. I remember suddenly being able to hear, as though for the first time, the loud and frenetic traffic all around us. He looked at me and very quietly replied, &#x201c;How many human beings do you see?&#x201d;<br><br> 10<br><br> In a flash, I understood the meaning of the story and the idea. Most of the people I was seeing, in the inner state they were in at that moment, were not really people at all. Most were what the Tibetans call &#x201c;hungry ghosts.&#x201d; They did not really exist. They were not really there. They were busy, they were in a hurry. They&#x2014;like all of us&#x2014; were obsessed with doing things right away. But right away is the opposite of now&#x2014;the opposite of the lived present moment in which the passing of time no longer tyrannizes us. The hungry ghosts are starved for &#x201c;more&#x201d; time; but the more time we hungry ghosts get, the more time we &#x201c;save,&#x201d; the hungrier we become, the less we actually live. And I understood that it is not exactly more time, more days and years, that we are starved for, it is the present moment. Through our increasing absorption in busyness, we have lost the present moment. &#x201c;Right away&#x201d; is not now. What a toxic illusion!<br><br> It is clear that there is less and less in our culture to help us remember what it means to be a human self, to have being in our presence&#x2014;inwardly to allow another, immeasurably finer sensitivity, another Self to &#x201c;arrive&#x201d; within and behind our thoughts, feelings and actions. To ask where are the people is to ask where are the influences, the reminders that can call us back to what we are meant to be inwardly&#x2014;to remind us that without inner presence our life in time will pass us by as though we never existed. Where are the ideas, the art, the literature, the science, the religion that can call meaningful time back into our lives? Above all, where are the people who can carry to us such ideas, such art, literature, science and religion, people who show us by the quality of their own lives, by their actions and &#x201c;emanations,&#x201d; that it is possible to live a fully human life within the very life we are obliged to live in this era with all its demands and constant change? Where are the people who demonstrate the metaphysical meaning of virtue and honor and love&#x2014;that is to say, their roots in the level of our being, rather than only in words and purported rules of conduct?<br><br> 11<br><br> In the few years since this book was first published, two major shocks have, each in its own way, made us more aware than ever of the metaphysical crisis of our common life in the modern world. The sudden revelation of widespread corruption in the heart of American business has come to us as a bizarre conclusion to and commentary upon a decade of neurotic consumerism and smoldering self-deceptive economic euphoria. As such, it has shown us something profoundly disturbing about the disappearance of character in the places of power and trust.<br><br> Of course, humanity being what it is, there has always been and there always will be po...</p><h2>The Community Mental Health System: A Navigational Guide for Providers</h2><p>The aim of this text is to provide mental health professionals, both those in the field and those in training, a better understanding of the service delivery system and ideas for how to work effectively in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It examines&nbsp;various driving forces&#x2014;deinstitutionalization, empirically based practices, managed care&#x2014;-both in the evolution of the present community mental health care system, &nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the impact on the&nbsp;overall system today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><p> <b>Elizabeth L.

In the fifth century A.D., Augustine of Hippo definitively enabled Christians to support Roman power directly by showing how the purpose of the state could be consistent with the purpose of Christianity. Christians could and should submit to the rule of Roman law and live within a society characterized by a plurality of religions.</p><p>But as David Lopez demonstrates in <i>Separatist Christianity</i>, the four centuries before Augustine witnessed a very different and far less nuanced doctrine. Through a close reading of canonical writings from the second and third centuries, he finds a Christianity that advocated a complete separation from the material and pagan Roman world. Incited by state persecution and cognizant of the fragility of their communities, church leaders and prominent Christian thinkers exhorted their followers to reject any accommodation with the Roman empire. To recognize imperial authority, they contended, would be to apostatize from the truth of Christianity. </p><p>Examining how ideas of martyrdom, apocalypse, and separation from the social and political world of Rome developed between the destruction of the Temple in 70 and Constantine's conversion in 312, Lopez finds a coherent and consistent anti-Roman sentiment in early Christianity. This radical agenda appears not only in the works by and about martyrs but also in the exegetical, disciplinary, and apologetic texts. By establishing the coherence and ubiquity of this separatist philosophy, Lopez offers a fresh new interpretation of the history of the early church.</p></p><p><p><b>David A. Lopez </b> is an assistant professor of religious studies at Siena Heights University.</p><p>"This book will make a good contribution to the field of early Christian studies by illuminating the important&#x2015;and often neglected&#x2015;question of the relationship between Christians and the state."</p> (Joyce E.

Whatever part you take&#x2014;rifleman, hospital orderly, mechanic, pilot, clerk, gunner, truck driver&#x2014;you will be an essential factor in a great effort.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>As American soldiers fanned out from their beachhead in Normandy in June of 1944 and began the liberation of France, every soldier carried that reminder in his kit. A compact trove of knowledge and reassurance, <i>Instructions for American Servicemen in France during World War II</i> was issued to soldiers just before they embarked for France to help them understand both why they were going and what they&#x2019;d find when they got there. After lying unseen in Army archives for decades, this remarkable guide is now available in a new facsimile edition that reproduces the full text and illustrations of the original along with a new introduction by Rick Atkinson setting the book in context. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Written in a straightforward, personal tone, the pamphlet is equal parts guidebook, cultural snapshot, and propaganda piece. A central aim is to dispel any prejudices American soldiers may have about the French&#x2014;especially relating to their quick capitulation in 1940. Warning soldiers that the defeat &#x201c;is a raw spot which the Nazis have been riding&#x201d; since the occupation began, <i>Instructions</i> is careful to highlight France&#x2019;s long historical role as a major U.S. ally. Following that is a brief, fascinating sketch of the French character (&#x201c;The French are mentally quick;&#x201d; &#x201c;Rich or poor, they are economical&#x201d;) and stark reminders of the deprivation the French have endured under occupation. Yet an air of reassuring confidence pervades the final section of the pamphlet, which reads like a straightforward tourists&#x2019; guide to Paris and the provinces&#x2014;like a promise of better days to come once the soldiers complete their mission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Written by anonymous War Department staffers to meet the urgent needs of the moment, with no thought of its historical value, <i>Instructions</i><i>for American Servicemen in France during World War II</i> nevertheless brings to vivid life the closing years of World War II&#x2014;when optimism was growing, but a long, demanding road still lay ahead.</p><p>"This little guide book is a small window into two worlds, and is an interesting addition to anyone's collection. . . .

Kraditor selects a group of suffragist leaders and investigates their thinking&#x2015;the ideas, and tactics, with which they battled the ideas and institutions impeding what suffragists defined as progress toward the equality of the sexes. She also examines what the American public believed "suffragism" to mean and how the major events of the time affected the movement.</p><p>Aileen S.

It is a novel about the clash of ideologies of two generations. The older generation, the fathers, represents an upper class whose power and influence is fading and giving way to the younger generation, the sons, who represent an increasing objection to the status quo. This conflict is embodied in the characters of Arkady Nikolaevich Kirsanov and Yevgeny Vasilevich Bazarov, two friends who have meet as students at St. Petersburg University. Arkady has recently graduated and has returned home to his father&#x2019;s small estate in an outlying province of Russia bringing his friend Yevgeny with him. What follows is uneasiness amongst the family when Arkady and Yevgeny&#x2019;s nihilistic views begin to emerge and are shown in conflict with the older generations more traditional views. &#x201c;Fathers and Sons&#x201d; is a brilliant work that captures the tension that existed among generations and class in the years leading up to the revolution in Russia.

Most recent philosophers reject the view and argue that all substantive knowledge must be sensory in origin. Laurence BonJour provocatively reopens the debate by presenting the most comprehensive exposition and defense of the rationalist view that a priori insight is a genuine basis for knowledge.</p><p>"...after reading his book we have a much better idea of the direction in which those answers must lie." Mylan Engel, Jr., Dialogue<br><br>"This book is an important contribution to the contemporary epistemological literature. The book is tightly organized, crisply argued, and sets the standard against which competing accounts must be measured. BonJour's book is rich and challenging...much can be learned from this book. It is required reading for anyserious student of the field and I entusiastically recommend it to nonspecialists as well." The Philosophical Review<br><br>"This work contains interesting criticisms of and rebuttals to opponents of rationalism. In addition it contains a bold, heady, imaginative positive account of pure reason. BonJour's bold answer consists of outlining and arguing for a theory of mental content that is nonrepresentational and at once both externalist as well as internalist. His imaginative conjecture is in the spirit of historic forms of rationalism: it is Aristotelian and Thomistic, in that the intellect in knowing necessary truths is in a sense all things; it is Hegelian in that the project critically argues for the coincidence of the real and the rational." Review of Meta Physics</p><h2>Suicide and the Soul (Dunquin Series: No. 8)</h2><p>With this book James Hillman initiated the "soul movement" in psychotherapy forty years ago. <p>Soul and suicide are dominant issues of this new millenium; soul because it cannot be reduced to genes and chromosomes; suicide because it raises fundamental religious, political, and legal conflicts. As Hillman writes in the postscript to the second edition: "The individual consists of more than his or her personal individuality. Something besides 'myself' inhabits the soul, takes part in its life and has a say in its death . . . We need a . . . definition of self as the interiorization of community. Suicide, literally 'self-killing,' now would mean both a killing of community and involvement of community in the killing." </p><p>This new edition is introduced by the eminent psychiatrist and pioneering social critic, Thomas Szasz.</p></p><p>The pioneering imaginative psychology of James Hillman that soon will span five decades has entered cultural history, affecting lives and minds in a wide range of fields. For the creativity of his thinking, the originator of Archetypal Psychology and author of A Terrible Love of War; The Soul&#39;s Code; and The Force of Character has received many honors, including the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic. He has held distinguished lectureships at Yale, Princeton, Chicago, and Syracuse Universities, and his books have been translated into some twenty languages. The American public showed its appreciation of his approach to psychology by placing his book, The Soul&#39;s Code, at the top of the bestseller list of serious works of nonfiction. Of his many books, Spring Publications has published Anima, Loose Ends, Archetypal Psychology: A Brief Account, Pan and the Nightmare, Suicide and the Soul, Insearch, Oedipus Variations (with Karl Ker�nyi), The Thought of the Heart and the Soul of the World, Inter Views, and Lectures on Jung&#39;s Typology (with Marie-Louise von Franz).

But in <i>Shakespeare from the Margins: Language, Culture, Context</i>, Patricia Parker, one of the most original interpreters of Shakespeare, argues that attention to Shakespearean wordplay reveals unexpected linkages, not only within and between plays but also between the plays and their contemporary culture.<br> <br> Combining feminist and historical approaches with attention to the "matter" of language as well as of race and gender, Parker's brilliant "edification from the margins" illuminates much that has been overlooked, both in Shakespeare and in early modern culture. This book, a reexamination of popular and less familiar texts, will be indispensable to all students of Shakespeare and the early modern period.<br></p></p><p></p><h2>Hysterical personality (Classical psychoanalysis and its applications)</h2><p>Hysterical Personality (Classical psychoanalysis and its applications) [Dec 01, 1977] Horowitz, Mardi Jon ... 0876682646</p><p></p><h2>Bessie Head: Thunder Behind Her Ears (Studies in African Literature.

The material he selects is mathematically elementary, yet exhibits the depth that is characteristic of truly great thought patterns in all ages. The success of this exposition is due to the author&#39;s unique approach to his subject. He wisely refrains from attempting a general survey of mathematics in antiquity, but selects, instead, a few representative items that he can treat in detail. He describes Babylonian mathematics as revealed from cuneiform texts discovered only recently, as well as more familiar topics developed by the Greeks. Although each chapter can be read as a separate unit, there are many connecting threads. Aaboe stays as close to the original texts as is comfortable for a modern reader, and the bibliography enables the interested student to delve more deeply into any aspect of ancient mathematics that catches his or her fancy.</p><p>Among other things, Aaboe shows us how the Babylonians did calculations, how Euclid proved that there are infinitely many primes, how Ptolemy constructed a trigonometric table in his Almagest, and how Archimedes trisected the angle.Asger Aaboe received his PhD degree from Brown University in 1957. He taught mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis, at Tufts University and at Birkerod Statsskole in Denmark. Aaboe went on to be Associate Professor of Mathematics and History of Science at Yale University.</p><h2>Ethnicity</h2><p>In this extensively revised edition, Steve Fenton updates his concise and accessible introduction to ethnicity, drawing on new published work and recent social and historical changes. Discussing an extended range of theorists and illustrations from around the world, Fenton explores and clarifies the core meanings and the shifting ground of this contested concept. More space is given to ideas of 'threat' and 'competition' in conceptualizing ethnicity, as well as to recent issues in migration, especially increased migration to the US from Central and South America. Fenton situates ethnic identities and interest in the changing modern world, and seeks to explain the contemporary conditions of delineation along ethnic and racial lines. Without assuming the centrality of ethnic difference, this book asks: Does it matter? When does it matter? Is it as important as many have assumed?<br> <br> The second edition of Fenton's highly regarded <i>Ethnicity</i> will continue to be an invaluable text for students of sociology, politics and international relations coming to the subject for the first time. Its innovative and challenging approach will also appeal to more advanced scholars of race and ethnicity.</p><p><b>Steve Fenton </b>is Professor of Sociology at University of Bristol."This is an excellent book and a very worthy contribution to the field. Fenton does a remarkably good job of synthesizing key debates in a contentious, very active field, doing so in a lively manner. Ranging broadly, he deals equally well with more conceptual as well as more empirical matters. He straightforwardly presents his own, quite sensible point of view, all the while consistently retaining an open, fair-minded approach to the intellectually and disciplinarily diverse set of authors that he discusses. The many historical and international cases discussed by the book make it of particular value."<br> <b>&#x2015;Roger Waldinger, University of California</b> <p>"This new edition of Steve Fenton's <i>Ethnicity</i> updates what was in any case one of most acute studies of the relation between ethnicity and other factors such as class. In the New Edition these issues are looked at in a wider context geographically including Latin America and Asia, while also bringing them up to date in the light of contemporary politics, new statistical material and recent theoretical debates."<br> <b>&#x2015;John Rex, University of Warwick</b></p> <p>"This new edition, even more than the original, is an exceptionally useful teaching tool. It is comprehensive, comprehensible, and concise, the three attributes we all look for when assigning books to our students. While it can serve well for undergraduates being introduced to the analysis of ethnicity, it is also a very good review of the scholarly work in this area so that advanced graduate students would do well to read it."<br> <b>&#x2015;Daniel Chirot, University of Washington</b></p></p><h2>The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914&#x2013;1945</h2><p><b>One of Germany&#x2019;s leading historians presents an ambitious and masterful account of the years encompassing the two world wars</b><br><br> Characterized by global war, political revolution and national crises, the period between 1914 and 1945 was one of the most horrifying eras in the history of the West. A noted scholar of modern German history<i>,</i> Heinrich August Winkler examines how and why Germany so radically broke with the normative project of the West and unleashed devastation across the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this total history of the thirty years between the start of World War One and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Winkler blends historical narrative with political analysis and encompasses military strategy, national identity, class conflict, economic development and cultural change. The book includes astutely observed chapters on the United States, Japan, Russia, Britain, and the other European powers, and Winkler&#x2019;s distinctly European perspective offers insights beyond the accounts written by his British and American counterparts.

Acclaimed technologist and inventor Amir Husain explains how we can live amidst the coming age of sentient machines and artificial intelligence&#x2014;and not only survive, but thrive.</b><br><br>Artificial &#x201c;machine&#x201d; intelligence is playing an ever-greater role in our society. We are already using cruise control in our cars, automatic checkout at the drugstore, and are unable to live without our smartphones. The discussion around AI is polarized; people think either machines will solve all problems for everyone, or they will lead us down a dark, dystopian path into total human irrelevance. Regardless of what you believe, the idea that we might bring forth intelligent creation can be intrinsically frightening. But what if our greatest role as humans so far is that of creators?<br> <br>Amir Husain, a brilliant inventor and computer scientist, argues that we are on the cusp of writing our next, and greatest, creation myth. It is the dawn of a new form of intellectual diversity, one that we need to embrace in order to advance the state of the art in many critical fields, including security, resource management, finance, and energy. &#x201c;In <i>The Sentient Machine</i>, Husain prepares us for a brighter future; not with hyperbole about right and wrong, but with serious arguments about risk and potential&#x201d; (Dr. Greg Hyslop, Chief Technology Officer, The Boeing Company). He addresses broad existential questions surrounding the coming of AI: Why are we valuable? What can we create in this world? How are we intelligent? What constitutes progress for us? And how might we fail to progress? Husain boils down complex computer science and AI concepts into clear, plainspoken language and draws from a wide variety of cultural and historical references to illustrate his points. Ultimately, Husain challenges many of our societal norms and upends assumptions we hold about &#x201c;the good life.&#x201d;</p><p>Amir Husain is an award-winning serial entrepreneur and inventor based in Austin, Texas.

Private and government organizations are developing programs to enhance the school readiness of all young children, especially children from economically disadvantaged homes and communities and children with special needs.</p> <p>Well-planned and effective assessment can inform teaching and program improvement, and contribute to better outcomes for children. This book affirms that assessments can make crucial contributions to the improvement of children's well-being, but only if they are well designed, implemented effectively, developed in the context of systematic planning, and are interpreted and used appropriately. Otherwise, assessment of children and programs can have negative consequences for both. The value of assessments therefore requires fundamental attention to their purpose and the design of the larger systems in which they are used.</p> <p><i>Early Childhood Assessment</i> addresses these issues by identifying the important outcomes for children from birth to age 5 and the quality and purposes of different techniques and instruments for developmental assessments.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>Summary</li><li>Part I: Early Childhood Assessment</li><li>1 Introduction</li><li>2 Purposeful Assessment</li><li>3 Perspectives on Early Childhood Learning Standards and Assessment</li><li>Part II: Child-Level Outcomes and Measures</li><li>4 Screening Young Children</li><li>5 Assessing Learning and Development</li><li>6 Measuring Quality in Early Childhood Environments</li><li>Part III: How to Assess</li><li>7 Judging the Quality and Utility of Assessments</li><li>8 Assessing All Children</li><li>9 Implementation of Early Childhood Assessments</li><li>Part IV: Assessing Systematically</li><li>10 Thinking Systematically</li><li>11 Guidance on Outcomes and Assessments</li><li>References</li><li>Appendix A: Glossary of Terms Related to Early Childhood Assessment</li><li>Appendix B: Information on Stakeholder Forum</li><li>Appendix C: Development of State Standards for Early Childhood Education</li><li>Appendix D: Sources of Detailed Information on Test and Assessment Instruments</li><li>Appendix E: Biographical Sketches of Committee Members and Staff</li><li>Index</li></ul></p><p>Catherine E.

Despite Sinclair&#x2019;s claim that this was his most important book, it was dismissed by critics and shunned by reviewers. Yet it sold over 150,000 copies and enjoyed numerous printings.<br> A substantial introduction to this paperback edition by Robert W.

No writer on the press has ever matched the old muckraker Sinclair (1878-1968) for exuberance and abundance. He is always personal, but always reaching beyond the personal; he did not fear to use his own divorce to illustrate newspaper malice and malfeasance. His portrait of the press of his era (and in particular The Associated Press) is thoroughly disheartening - an institution in thrall to corporate policy and publishers&#39; whims, using untruths, dirty tricks, and blackouts to serve political ends...

A recognized expert in vulnerability analysis, secure systems/software design, network security, access control, authentication, and UNIX security, Bishop also works to improve computer security instruction.</p> <br> <br><p>Hortensio: Madam, before you touch the instrument<br>To learn the order of my fingering,<br>I must begin with rudiments of art<br>To teach you gamouth in a briefer sort,<br>More pleasant, pithy and effectual,<br>Than hath been taught by any of my trade;<br>And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.<br> <i>The Taming of the Shrew,</i> III, i, 62-68.</p> <p>On September 11, 2001, terrorists seized control of four airplanes. Three were flown into buildings, and a fourth crashed, with catastrophic loss of life. In the aftermath, the security and reliability of many aspects of society drew renewed scrutiny. One of these aspects was the widespread use of computers and their interconnecting networks.</p> <p>The issue is not new. In 1988, approximately 5,000 computers throughout the Internet were rendered unusable within 4 hours by a program called a worm. While the spread, and the effects, of this program alarmed computer scientists, most people were not worried because the worm did not affect their lives or their ability to do their jobs. In 1993, more users of computer systems were alerted to such dangers when a set of programs called sniffers were placed on many computers run by network service providers and recorded login names and passwords.</p> <p>After an attack on Tsutomu Shimomura's computer system, and the fascinating way Shimomura followed the attacker's trail, which led to his arrest, the public's interest and apprehension were finally aroused. Computers were now vulnerable. Their once reassuring protections were now viewed as flimsy.</p> <p>Several films explored these concerns. Movies such as <i>War Games</i> and <i>Hackers</i> provided images of people who can, at will, wander throughout computers and networks, maliciously or frivolously corrupting or destroying information it may have taken millions of dollars to amass. (Reality intruded on Hackers when the World Wide Web page set up by MGM/United Artists was quickly altered to present an irreverent commentary on the movie and to suggest that viewers see <i>The Net</i> instead. Paramount Pictures denied doing this.) Another film, <i>Sneakers,</i> presented a picture of those who test the security of computer (and other) systems for their owners and for the government.</p> <p><b>Goals</b></p> <p>This book has three goals. The first is to show the importance of theory to practice and of practice to theory. All too often, practitioners regard theory as irrelevant and theoreticians think of practice as trivial. In reality, theory and practice are symbiotic. For example, the theory of covert channels, in which the goal is to limit the ability of processes to communicate through shared resources, provides a mechanism for evaluating the effectiveness of mechanisms that confine processes, such as sandboxes and firewalls. Similarly, business practices in the commercial world led to the development of several security policy models such as the Clark-Wilson model and the Chinese Wall model. These models in turn help the designers of security policies better understand and evaluate the mechanisms and procedures needed to secure their sites.</p> <p>The second goal is to emphasize that computer security and cryptography are different. Although cryptography is an essential component of computer security, it is by no means the only component. Cryptography provides a mechanism for performing specific functions, such as preventing unauthorized people from reading and altering messages on a network. However, unless developers understand the context in which they are using cryptography, and unless the assumptions underlying the protocol and the cryptographic mechanisms apply to the context, the cryptography may not add to the security of the system. The canonical example is the use of cryptography to secure communications between two low-security systems. If only trusted users can access the two systems, cryptography protects messages in transit. But if untrusted users can access either system (through authorized accounts or, more likely, by breaking in), the cryptography is not sufficient to protect the messages. The attackers can read the messages at either endpoint.</p> <p>The third goal is to demonstrate that computer security is not just a science but also an art. It is an art because no system can be considered secure without an examination of how it is to be used. The definition of a "secure computer" necessitates a statement of requirements and an expression of those requirements in the form of authorized actions and authorized users. (A computer engaged in work at a university may be considered "secure" for the purposes of the work done at the university. When moved to a military installation, that same system may not provide sufficient control to be deemed "secure" for the purposes of the work done at that installation.) How will people, as well as other computers, interact with the computer system? How clear and restrictive an interface can a designer create without rendering the system unusable while trying to prevent unauthorized use or access to the data or resources on the system?</p> <p>Just as an artist paints his view of the world onto canvas, so does a designer of security features articulate his view of the world of human/machine interaction in the security policy and mechanisms of the system. Two designers may use entirely different designs to achieve the same creation, just as two artists may use different subjects to achieve the same concept.</p> <p>Computer security is also a science. Its theory is based on mathematical constructions, analyses, and proofs. Its systems are built in accordance with the accepted practices of engineering. It uses inductive and deductive reasoning to examine the security of systems from key axioms and to discover underlying principles. These scientific principles can then be applied to untraditional situations and new theories, policies, and mechanisms.</p> <p><b>Philosophy</b></p> <p>Key to understanding the problems that exist in computer security is a recognition that the problems are not new. They are old problems, dating from the beginning of computer security (and, in fact, arising from parallel problems in the noncomputer world). But the locus has changed as the field of computing has changed. Before the mid-1980s, mainframe and mid-level computers dominated the market, and computer security problems and solutions were phrased in terms of securing files or processes on a single system. With the rise of networking and the Internet, the arena has changed. Workstations and servers, and the networking infrastructure that connects them, now dominate the market. Computer security problems and solutions now focus on a networked environment. However, if the workstations and servers, and the supporting network infrastructure, are viewed as a single system, the models, theories, and problem statements developed for systems before the mid-1980s apply equally well to current systems.</p> <p>As an example, consider the issue of assurance. In the early period, assurance arose in several ways: formal methods and proofs of correctness, validation of policy to requirements, and acquisition of data and programs from trusted sources, to name a few. Those providing assurance analyzed a single system, the code on it, and the sources (vendors and users) from which the code could be acquired to ensure that either the sources could be trusted or the programs could be confined adequately to do minimal damage. In the later period, the same basic principles and techniques apply, except that the scope of some has been greatly expanded (from a single system and a small set of vendors to the world-wide Internet). The work on proof-carrying code, an exciting development in which the proof that a downloadable program module satisfies a stated policy is incorporated into the program itself, is an example of this expansion. It extends the notion of a proof of consistency with a stated policy. It advances the technology of the earlier period into the later period. But in order to understand it properly, one must understand the ideas underlying the concept of proof-carrying code, and these ideas lie in the earlier period.</p> <p>As another example, consider Saltzer and Schroeder's principles of secure design. Enunciated in 1975, they promote simplicity, confinement, and understanding. When security mechanisms grow too complex, attackers can evade or bypass them. Many programmers and vendors are learning this when attackers break into their systems and servers. The argument that the principles are old, and somehow outdated, rings hollow when the result of their violation is a nonsecure system.</p> <p>The work from the earlier period is sometimes cast in terms of systems that no longer exist and that differ in many ways from modern systems. This does not vitiate the ideas and concepts, which also underlie the work done today. Once these ideas and concepts are properly understood, applying them in a multiplicity of environments becomes possible. Furthermore, the current mechanisms and technologies will become obsolete and of historical interest themselves as new forms of computing arise, but the underlying principles will live on, to underlie the next generation--indeed the next era--of computing.</p> <p>The philosophy of this book is that certain key concepts underlie all of computer security, and that the study of all parts of computer security enriches the understanding of all parts. Moreover, critical to an understanding of the applications of security-related technologies and methodologies is an understanding of the theory underlying those applications.</p> <p>Advances in the theory of computer protection have illuminated the foundations of security systems. Issues of abstract modeling, and modeling to meet specific environments, lead to systems designed to achieve a specific and rewarding goal. Theorems about the undecidability of the general security question have indicated the limits of what can be done.</p> <p>Application of these results has improved the quality of the security of the systems being protected. However, the issue is how compatibly the assumptions of the model (and theory) conform to the environment to which the theory is applied. Although our knowledge of how to apply these abstractions is continually increasing, we still have difficulty correctly transposing the relevant information from a realistic setting to one in which analyses can then proceed. Such abstraction often eliminates vital information. The omitted data may pertain to security in nonobvious ways. Without this information, the analysis is flawed.</p> <p> Unfortunately, no single work can cover all aspects of computer security, so this book focuses on those parts that are, in the author's opinion, most fundamental and most pervasive. The mechanisms exemplify the applications of these principles.</p> <p><b>Organization</b></p> <p>The organization of this book reflects its philosophy. It begins with fundamentals and principles that provide boundaries within which security can be modeled and analyzed effectively. This provides a framework for expressing and analyzing the requirements of the security of a system. These policies constrain what is allowed and what is not allowed. Mechanisms provide the ability to implement these policies. The degree to which the mechanisms correctly implement the policies, and indeed the degree to which the policies themselves meet the requirements of the organizations using the system, are questions of assurance. Exploiting failures in policy, in implementation, and in assurance comes next, as well as mechanisms for providing information on the attack. The book concludes with the applications of both theory and policy focused on realistic situations. This natural progression emphasizes the development and application of the principles existent in computer security.</p> <p>The first chapter describes what computer security is all about and explores the problems and challenges to be faced. It sets the context for the remainder of the book.</p> <p>Chapters 2 and 3 deal with basic questions such as how "security" can be clearly and functionally defined, whether or not it is realistic, and whether or not it is decidable.</p> <p>Chapters 4 through 7 probe the relationship between policy and security. The definition of "security" depends on policy. We examine several types of policies, including the ever-present fundamental questions of trust, analysis of policies, and the use of policies to constrain operations and transitions.Chapters 9 through 12 discuss cryptography and its role in security, focusing on applications and issues such as key management, key distribution, and how cryptosystems are used in networks. A quick study of authentication completes this part.</p> <p>Chapters 13 through 16 consider how to implement the requirements imposed by policies using system-oriented techniques. Certain design principles are fundamental to effective security mechanisms. Policies define who can act and how they can act, and so identity is a critical aspect of implementation. Mechanisms implementing access control and flow control enforce various aspects of policies.</p> <p>Chapters 17 and 18 present concepts and standards used to ascertain how well a system, or a product, meets its goals.</p> <p>Chapters 19 through 22 discuss some miscellaneous aspects of computer security. Malicious logic thwarts many mechanisms. Despite our best efforts at high assurance, systems today are replete with vulnerabilities. Why? How can a system be analyzed to detect vulnerabilities? What models might help us improve the state of the art? Given these security holes, how can we detect attackers who exploit them? A discussion of auditing flows naturally into a discussion of intrusion detection--a detection method for such attacks.</p> <p>Chapters 23 through 26 present examples of how to apply the principles discussed throughout the book. They begin with networks and proceed to systems, users, and programs. Each chapter states a desired policy and shows how to translate that policy into a set of mechanisms and procedures that support the policy. This part tries to demonstrate that the material covered elsewhere can be, and should be, used in practice.</p> <p>Each chapter in this book ends with a summary and some suggestions for further reading. The summary highlights the important ideas in the chapter. Interested readers who wish to pursue the topics in any chapter in more depth can go to some of the suggested readings. They expand on the material in the chapter or present other interesting avenues.</p> <p><b>Differences Between this Book and <i>Computer Security: Art and Science</i> </b></p> <p>The differences between this book and <i>Computer Security: Art and Science</i> result from the different intended audiences. This book is a shorter version of the latter, omitting much of the mathematical formalism. It is suited for computer security professionals, students, and prospective readers who have a less formal mathematical background, or who are not interested in the mathematical formalisms and would only be distracted by them, or for courses with a more practical than theoretical focus.</p> <p>The foundations and policy sections of this book do not present results involving formal modeling or derivations of limits on the decidability of security (although it does present the central result, that the generic safety problem is undecidable). Some policies, significant in the history of the development of policy models but no longer used widely, have been omitted, as has discussion of the notions of nondeducibility and noninterference. Further, the section on assurance omits the presentation of formal methods and the detailed discussion of designing and building secure systems.

During that time, China, not Europe, was the center of the world: the European voyages of exploration were searching not just for new lands but also for new trade routes to the Far East. In this book, Timothy Brook eloquently narrates the changing landscape of life over the three centuries of the Ming (1368-1644), when China was transformed from a closely administered agrarian realm into a place of commercial profits and intense competition for status.<br><br><i>The Confusions of Pleasure</i> marks a significant departure from the conventional ways in which Chinese history has been written. Rather than recounting the Ming dynasty in a series of political events and philosophical achievements, it narrates this <i>longue dur�e</i> in terms of the habits and strains of everyday life. Peppered with stories of real people and their negotiations of a rapidly changing world, this book provides a new way of seeing the Ming dynasty that not only contributes to the scholarly understanding of the period but also provides an entertaining and accessible introduction to Chinese history for anyone.</p><p>&#34;This is joyful and comprehensive scholarship, full of motion and detail. Timothy Brook encases the fascinating and changeable world of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) in a clear conceptual and chronological framework which any non-specialist can follow. Here are a wealth of Ming people and their problems, along with the very stuff of their world: bricks and bridges; markets, monasteries, and mail; famines and fashion; printing, passion, and portents.

In this work, Doka and Martin elaborate on their conceptual model of "styles or patterns of grieving" &#x2013; a model that has generated both research and acceptance since the publication of the first edition in 1999. In that book, as well as in this revision, Doka and Martin explore the different ways that individuals grieve, noting that gender is only one factor that affects an individual&#x2019;s style or pattern of grief. The book differentiates intuitive grievers, where the pattern is more affective, from instrumental grievers, who grieve in a more cognitive and behavioral way, while noting other patterns that might be more blended or dissonant. The model is firmly grounded in social science theory and research. A particular strength of the work is the emphasis placed on the clinical implications of the model on the ways that different types of grievers might best be supported through individual counseling or group support.</p><p><p>Kenneth J.

At the heart of The Temple stands &#34;The Church,&#34; poems that are patterned on the Church&#39;s liturgical calendar and that discuss theological ideas such as death, judgment, and heaven. Herbert&#39;s poetry is at once personal and confessional. His poems about the Eucharist and holy baptism are not only general theological explorations of the sacraments but also the poet&#39;s expression of the struggles of his own flesh to be reconciled to God.

As Jonathan Lethem contends in his Introduction, Dickens&#x2019;s &#x201c;genius . . . is at one with the genius of the form of the novel itself: Dickens willed into existence the most capacious and elastic and versatile kind of novel that could be, one big enough for his vast sentimental yearnings and for every impulse and fear and hesitation in him that countervailed those yearnings too. Never parsimonious and frequently contradictory, he always gives us everything he can, everything he&#x2019;s planned to give, and then more.&#x201d; This Modern Library Paperback Classic was set from the 1867 &#x201c;Charles Dickens&#x201d; edition.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no writing against such power as this&#x2014;one has no chance.&#x201d;&#x2014;William Makepeace Thackeray</p><h2>Decrypted Secrets: Methods and Maxims of Cryptology</h2><p>Cryptology, for millennia a &#34;secret science&#34;, is rapidly gaining in pr actical importance for the protection of communication channels, datab ases, and software.

He was in demand across the country for his speeches on team work, motivation, and inspiration, and was the bestselling author of BO. JOHN U. BACON is a top sports journalist based in Michigan and a long-time associate of Bo Schembechler.The famed Michigan football coach offers lessons on being an effective leader and manager, gleaned from years of shaping one of the nation's winningest college teams. A better voice could not have been found to drive home his points. John Mayer's gravelly yet clear tone enthusiastically invokes the mantras the coach prescribes for leadership success: Be passionate about your job; seek a mentor, not money, when starting out; respect and listen to your people; don't hold grudges; and take pride in what you do. Key points are repeated with a musical backdrop at the end of sections--these summaries are very helpful. Of course, there are football anecdotes, but none that a nonfan won't understand. An interesting interview with coauthor Bacon concludes the book.

Santore is best known for his luminous interpretations of classic children&#x2019;s stories such as Snow White, The Night Before Christmas and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x2019;s Paul Revere&#x2019;s Ride, which was named 2004 Children&#x2019;s Book of the Year for Poetry by the Bank Street College Children&#x2019;s Book Committee.

Original.</p><p>The fifth and apparently concluding volume of Rocheworld takes up the saga after the marooned expedition of 10 humans and 3 flouwen (i.e., aquatic sapients) has survived on the Rocheworld's habitable moon for a good many years. Now the second expedition from Earth, long in preparation, finally arrives, with strict orders to cart all humans back to their native planet. Problem is, Rocheworld humans feel they are already home and have no wish to leave. The ensuing conflict features plenty of action, much scientific ingenuity, and a good deal of wry wit. Forward and his various collaborators have always been well in the forefront among producers of readable hard sf, and this book continues their streak. Certainly no one who has followed the Rocheworld for four books will want to abandon it before finishing the fifth. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>F. Scott Fitzgerald on Authorship</h2><p>Assembling letters and notebook entries with articles and reviews written for publication, F. Scott Fitzgerald on Authorship provides Fitzgerald's public and private writings on his trade and craft. The forty-six selections in this volume construct an autobiographical account of Fitzgerald's twenty-year endeavor to maintain careers as a commercial writer and as a literary artist. Offering a clear sense of his seriousness about writing, they correct misconceptions that have impeded a proper assessment of Fitzgerald's professional authorship and distorted his reputation as a man of letters.<br>In a substantial introduction to the volume, Matthew J. Bruccoli positions Fitzgerald as a case history for the profession-of-authorship approach to American literary history formulated by William Charvat. Bruccoli notes that more is known about the professional life of Fitzgerald than about that of any other major American author, and, drawing on that wealth of information, he challenges familiar myths about Fitzgerald's squandering of fortunes and literary genius. Bruccoli exposes the error of segregating Fitzgerald's magazine and movie work from his novels, suggesting instead that a symbiotic relationship exists among these works and ties them together.<br>In his own words, Fitzgerald corrects the most condescending and irksome notion about him - that he was a literary ignoramus who wrote brilliantly without knowing what he was doing. As these letters, notebook entries, book reviews, and articles clearly indicate, Fitzgerald reached usable conclusions about the craft of writing, the discipline of authorship, and the obligations of literature.</p><p>In honor of Fitzgerald's birthday centennial, the University of South Carolina and its press are rolling out the red carpet with a celebration rivaling a party at Gatsby's. The publisher is releasing an unprecedented three volumes by or about the great writer, all of which have been edited by leading Fitzgerald biographer and scholar Bruccoli. The Centenary Exhibition is the program of a unique display of Fitzgerald memorabilia from Bruccoli's private collection on view at the university's Thomas Cooper Library in Columbia (and available on a web site at ). Fie! Fie! Fi-Fi! is a facsimile of the script for the two-act musical comedy written by Fitzgerald as a Princeton undergraduate in 1914. The show will be staged for the first time in 82 years as part of the university's festivities. On Authorship collects 46 pieces that present a portrait of Fitzgerald as both a commercial writer and literary artist. The selections include letters, notebook entries, book reviews, and articles that highlight Fitzgerald's discipline and dedication to the craft of writing. This centenary trilogy is the literary publishing event of the year and the perfect way to honor one of our nation's greatest men of letters. For Fitzgerald aficionados, it is a celebration just this side of paradise.

We meet young men who felt their schools empowered and emasculated them, parents who were frustrated with co-ed schools, teachers who helped pave the road to college, and administrators who saw in Black male academies the advantages of privatizing education.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the two schools have distinctive histories and ultimately charted different paths, they were both shaped by the convergence of neoliberal ideologies and a politics of Black respectability. As Blume Oeur reveals, all-boys education is less a school reform initiative and instead joins a legacy of efforts to reform Black manhood during periods of stark racial inequality. Black male academies join long-standing attempts to achieve racial uplift in Black communities, but in ways that elevate exceptional young men and aggravate divisions within those communities.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Black Boys Apart</i> shows all-boys schools to be an odd mix of democratic empowerment and market imperatives, racial segregation and intentional sex separation, strict discipline and loving care. Challenging narratives that endorse these schools for nurturing individual resilience in young Black men, this perceptive and penetrating ethnography argues for a holistic approach in which Black communities and their allies promote a collective resilience.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p>Freeden Blume Oeur is associate professor of sociology at Tufts University.

However, the church that is visible today is a youthful upstart, only four hundred years old compared to the twelve-hundred-year-old church whose site it occupies. A very small proportion of the original is now extant, entirely covered over by the new basilica, but enough survives to make reconstruction of the first St Peter&#39;s possible and much new evidence has been uncovered in the past thirty years. This is the first full study of the older church, from its late antique construction to Renaissance destruction, in its historical context.

Barber and Fleming take up that call, arguing for a philosophic approach to constitutional interpretation. In doing so, they systematically critique the competing approaches - textualism, consensualism, originalism, structuralism, doctrinalism, minimalism, and pragmatism - that aim and claim to avoid a philosophic approach. <em>Constitutional Interpretation: The Basic Questions</em> illustrates that these approaches cannot avoid philosophic reflection and choice in interpreting the Constitution. Barber and Fleming contend that fidelity in constitutional interpretation requires a fusion of philosophic and other approaches, properly understood. Within such a fusion, interpreters would begin to think of text, consensus, intentions, structures, and doctrines not as alternatives to, but as sites of philosophic reflection about the best understanding of our constitutional commitments. <em>Constitutional Interpretation: The Basic Questions</em>, examines the fundamental inquiries that arise in interpreting constitutional law. In doing so, the authors survey the controversial and intriguing questions that have stirred constitutional debate in the United States for over two centuries, such as: how and for what ends should governmental institutions and powers be arranged; what does the Constitution mean under general circumstances and how should it be interpreted during concrete controversies; and finally how do we decide what our constitution means and who ultimately decides its meaning.<br></p><p>Sotirios Barber is Professor of Politial Science, University of Notre Dame.

In this splendidly illustrated book - the only comprehensive volume on Menzel in English - photographs of the artist and contemporary Berlin accompany reproductions of hundreds of his paintings and drawings. Menzel specialists and art historians contribute chapters on his life and art, his visits to France, his critical reception, relevant social and historical background, and different approaches to his work.<br>Until recently, Menzel's many paintings and drawings were separated from one another in collections on either side of the Berlin Wall. Now, in the wake of reunification, the Berlin Museums have put together the most extensive Menzel exhibit since the retrospective that followed his death in 1905. This book is the catalogue for the exhibit that had its debut at the Musee D'Orsay in Paris (April 15 to July 28), travels to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (September 15, 1996 to January 5, 1997) and returns to Nationalgalerie in Berlin (February 7 to May 11, 1997).</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanThe reunification of Germany has obvious political fallout but less obvious artistic results. The reassembled collections of German art offer new possibilities for shows, and one such is Adolph Menzel 1815-1905: Between Romanticism and Impressionism which is now showing at Washington's National Gallery until January 5, 1997. Although famed during his life as a member of the Royal Academy, a painter of genre scenes and a favorite of the Prussian court, Menzel is recognized today for the informal landscapes and interiors from the 1840s that were almost unknown during his life. The show's catalogue, edited by Claude Keisch and Marie-Ursula Riemann-Reyher, collects essays on Menzel's life, times, work and influences, as well as 450 illustrations, 162 in color.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Other Side of Death: What the Bible Teaches About Heaven and Hell</h2><p>A study of heaven, hell, and life beyond death. Specific topics include marriage in heaven, infant death, purgatory, and the location of heaven.</p><p>J. Sidlow Baxter is the author of more than 20 books and has ministered in churches and Bible conferences throughout the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. Renowned for his biblical understanding and ability to expound truth, he has been heard by thousands. His books have been read and recommended by Christian leaders and speakers. His most famous work is <i>Explore the Book</i>, and multi-volume interpretative commentary on the whole Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. In addition to <i>Mark These Men</i>, Kregel Publications also publishes Baxter's <i>Does God Still Guide?</i> and <i>The Strategic Grasp of the Bible</i>.</p><h2>Michelangelo and His Drawings</h2><p>Focuses on the drawings of the artist famous for his sculptures and his work on the Sistine Chapel ceiling</p><p>This valuable study explores Michelangelo's working methods and mental processes. The book's ten chapters analyze half the surviving drawings, some of which are referenced in more than one context. The text is organized by type of drawing: initial sketches, life studies, compositional drawings, architectural designs, and finished drawings used as gifts. It is followed by a thematically arranged index of drawings and a section of some 220 illustrations. In examining the artist's draughtsmanship (including media, attitude towards his work, and efforts made to procure the drawings once he was famous), Hirst clarifies the purpose of the works and why they look as they do.

Alley, Human Ethology Bulletin</p><h2>Text and Act: Essays on Music and Performance</h2><p>Over the last dozen years, the writings of Richard Taruskin have transformed the debate about "early music" and "authenticity." <em>Text and Act</em> collects for the first time the most important of Taruskin's essays and reviews from this period, many of which now classics in the field. Taking a wide-ranging cultural view of the phenomenon, he shows that the movement, far from reviving ancient traditions, in fact represents the only truly modern style of performance being offered today. He goes on to contend that the movement is therefore far more valuable and even authentic than the historical verisimilitude for which it ostensibly strives could ever be. These essays cast fresh light on many aspects of contemporary music-making and music-thinking, mixing lighthearted debunking with impassioned argumentation. Taruskin ranges from theoretical speculation to practical criticism, and covers a repertory spanning from Bach to Stravinsky. Including a newly written introduction, <em>Text and Act</em> collects the very best of one of our most incisive musical thinkers.<br></p><p>Music lovers who have watched the "authenticity" (period instrument) wars of the 1980s and 1990s could be excused for forgetting that Richard Taruskin is a musicologist and professor by trade, not a professional critic. For it is as an essayist and critic (if not a professional gadfly) that he has made a real impact on American musical culture. Indeed, in early-music circles, and even in the marketing of period-instrument performances by record labels, the word <i>authentic</i> has been abandoned almost entirely--and this is due largely to Taruskin's impassioned arguments (and his ability to get them published in places like <i>The New York Times</i>).<p> <i>Text &amp; Act</i> is a collection of Taruskin's most important (or, at least, most inflammatory) essays and articles on the subject of authenticity in the performance of 18th- and 19th-century music. These are the pieces that got Taruskin a reputation for being a flame-thrower; many fans of what is now called HIP (historically informed performance) have gotten the idea that Taruskin is the enemy of everything HIP stands for. They should have a look at this book: they'll see that he actually applauds many of the HIP movement's achievements. (In fact, Taruskin was himself a Baroque cellist and a founding member of the New York period-instrument orchestra Concert Royal.) What he skewers mercilessly are the pretensions and a few of the assumptions on which HIP was originally based and that it used to market itself.</p><p> Readers will also see why Taruskin has deeply infuriated so many people. He regularly makes inflammatory (if not downright insulting) statements at the outset of an essay and then backpedals in the middle. He quotes a statement by another writer or musician, draws implications from that statement that are far more extensive than the speaker apparently intended, and then demolishes those implications and often mocks the unwitting speaker. Especially in his introduction (which I recommend you skip until you've read the rest of the book), he continues to fight battles that he has already won, even as he seems to brag of his triumphs.</p><p> Nevertheless, Taruskin's main points are persuasive. They may even seem obvious, but all too many musicians seem to have forgotten them. "Authenticity" in the sense of a faithful re-creation of the composer's intentions and preferred conditions of performance is simply not an achievable goal. We can't know the composer's real intentions (he or she is almost certainly dead), and re-creating original performance conditions is unfeasible (we can't spend the equivalent of the unlimited budget Louis XIV had for his operas, and there are no more French nobles trained in Baroque dance to do the ballets), if not impossible (there are no more 14-year-old boy sopranos to sing Taverner's masses or Bach's soprano solos). There's no point in having as a goal a performance that would please the composer--again, the composer is (as a rule) dead. What's important is a performance that pleases us, the people performing and listening to the music now. So for anyone who wants to understand the early-music revival of the late 20th century and the debates surrounding it, this book is indispensable. Just don't be surprised if you want to smack the author every so often. <i>--Matthew Westphal</i></p>Richard Taruskin is at University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>The Daily Edge: Simple Strategies to Increase Efficiency and Make an Impact Every Day</h2><p><i>Wall Street Journal</i> bestselling author David Horsager frequently hears executives lament that their hands are more than full trying to balance the barrage of tasks they face on a daily basis.

Written with the grace, verve, and style of one of literature's most sophisticated entertainers, these books not only reveal Updike's genius in characterization and his formal versatility as a novelist but also delve into the complexities of sex and marriage, social class and personal morality, and the difficult quandaries of the flesh and the spirit.

Twenty preeminent scholars from diverse cultural backgrounds investigate how the vast sociopolitical changes of the post-World War II era affected these women and how the ensuing events influenced the art that they produced. This book outlines the role these pivotal artists and their work played in reshaping the California cultural profile into what it is today.<br><br>Illustrated with more than one hundred color plates and duotones, <i>Art/Women/California 1950-2000 </i>reveals the richness of this fifty-year period by contrasting and comparing the artists and their varied artistic practices in relation to the larger sociopolitical context. The book employs a variety of historical perspectives to reflect the distinct and parallel experiences of California's major cultural communities while revealing points of intersection by analyzing shared themes and practices.<br><br>Because California serves as a gateway for a myriad of immigrants and an epicenter for the feminist movement, and because of its history of activism, its culture of experimentation, and its reputation for innovative technology and media, the state has evolved into a crucial and inspirational environment for women artists. Their work continues to transform our perceptions and revitalize art's connections to its surrounding environment and community.

Howard Series)</h2><p>Robert E. Howard is celebrated as the founding father of sword-and-sorcery, the creator of Conan of Cimmeria and Kull of Atlantis. <i>The Black Stranger and Other American Tales</i> demonstrates that in some of his most powerful heroic fantasy and horror stories, he also explored a New World older and more haunted than that which we&#x2019;ve seen in textbooks or museum exhibits. In Howard's Gothic America, dominion goes hand in hand with damnation and the present never ceases to writhe in the grip of the past.&nbsp;"The Black Stranger" spearheads the collection. Located at the extreme edge of Hyborian geography and human ruthlessness, this Conan novella has seldom been available until now. All of the Cimmerian's lethal skills may not be enough inside a stockade that shelters a self-exiled, pirate-plagued count, besieged from without and bedeviled from within. Against the backdrop of a demonically hostile dreadwood, Howard recreates the worst nightmares of the earliest European invaders of North America.&nbsp;In the tales that follow, Howard unearths sinister civilizations that have forgotten the mysteries of their origins on American soil tens of thousands of years ago. That soil is a dark and bloody ground, beneath which the monstrous heirs of ancient wrongs and unsuspected wars wait. A Comanche champion and a lone conquistador stumble upon empires carved out of the primordial Southwest by necromancers. Hot hate given cold flesh lurches on zuvembie legs in "Pigeons from Hell" and lurks in the shuddersome swamps of the Deep South in "Black Canaan."&nbsp;These stories, here refurbished with authoritative, unexpurgated texts, have transcended the Thirties pulps in which they first saw print. With their unflinching focus on original American sin and even more original sinners, some are sure to take their place next to dark classics like "Young Goodman Brown," "Benito Cereno," and "A Rose for Emily."</p><p>Robert E. Howard (1906&#x2013;36) lived and wrote in Cross Plains, Texas. From 1924 until his death, he sold hundreds of stories to pulp-fiction magazines such as <i>Weird Tales</i>, <i>Argosy</i>, <i>Action Stories</i>, <i>Fight Stories</i>, and <i>Cowboy Stories</i>. As a twentieth-century American master of fantastic adventure, he rivals Edgar Rice Burroughs.

However, written two thousand years ago, the book can be somewhat daunting to the modern reader.<br><br>Now Mark McNeilly, author of <em>Sun Tzu and the Art of Business</em>, which made Sun Tzu accessible to the business executive, has extracted the six concepts most applicable to modern warfare, making them easy to understand and apply to military situations. Drawing on a wealth of fascinating historical examples, McNeilly shows how these six principles might be used in wars of the future-both conventional wars and terrorist conflicts-and how they can provide insight into current affairs, such as the war on terrorism and China's increasingly important strategic and military role in the world. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, McNeilly has written a new chapter for this paperback edition, which addresses how Sun Tzu's ideas can be applied to the war on terrorism. He also describes how to win the information war, how to lead by example, and how to use alliances to defeat the opponent.<br><br>Including the full text of <em>The Art of War</em> in the popular translation by Samuel Griffith, with cross-references to quotations used in the book, <em>Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare</em> unlocks these elusive secrets for anyone interested in strategy and warfare, whether they are professional soldiers, military history buffs, or business executives.</p><p>"When the strike of a hawk breaks the body of its prey, it is because of timing." So wrote the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu more than two millennia ago in the text that has come to be known as <i>The Art of War,</i> one that guides military planners to this day. Former infantry officer Mark McNeilly examines the lessons of Sun Tzu's book not metaphorically, as he did for the boardroom in his <i>Sun Tzu and the Art of Business,</i> but literally, considering its dicta on such matters as the necessity of speedy action and solid leadership in the light of real battles and campaigns throughout history--and those yet to be fought. For instance, McNeilly looks at the Allied victory over Iraq in the light of Sun Tzu's pronouncement, "Just as flowing water avoids the heights and hastens to the lowlands, so an army avoids strength and strikes weakness." Matching intelligent commentary with a complete text of Sun Tzu's classic, McNeilly's book is of much interest to students of military history and current events alike. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><br>Mark McNeilly is the author of&nbsp;<i>Sun Tzu and the Art of Business: Six Strategic Principles for Managers</i>.

Winston Link photographs. He soon began making annual trips to the West Virginia and eastern Kentucky coalfields, destinations that strongly resonated with his own aesthetic of "place." Armed with a used Leica M6 and gritty Tri-X film, he and his wife made six week-long trips in the dead of winter to photograph trains along the Pocahontas Division of the Norfolk Southern Railway. Nearly one hundred images edited from this body of work form the core of <i>The Railroad and the Art of Place</i>, along with a selection of earlier Pennsylvania Railroad steam-era photographs that reflect Kahler&#x2019;s interest in the railroad landscape from an early age. Also included are three essays by Kahler, Scott Lothes, and Jeff Brouws, discussing the personal motivations, historical context, and aesthetic development behind the photography. With funding for printing provided by the Kahler Family Charitable Fund, all sales will go to support the Center&#x2019;s work.</p></p><p><p>David Kahler was born in 1937, spending his formative years in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, at the junction of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Wilmington Northern Branch of the Reading Railroad. In 1951, he began photographing the railroad environment in the Keystone State with a camera borrowed from his aunt. Today, he continues his passion for trains and the environment by photographing the decaying remains of historic railroads and industrial sites found in North Carolina, northeastern Pennsylvania, and northeastern Maine.</p></p><h2>Technical Skills for Adventure Programming: A Curriculum Guide</h2><p><p>If you're looking for a book that will improve your knowledge and technical instruction skills in land, water, and snow and ice sports and activities, this is it! <i>Technical Skills for Adventure Programming: A Curriculum Guide</i> is an all-in-one resource, based on current methods, that will guide you in becoming a skilled adventure instructor in the classroom and in the field. </p><p>This book includes</p><p>-comprehensive units with lesson plans for 12 popular outdoor adventure activities;</p><p>-7 to 15 progressive, pedagogically sound lesson plans for each unit, featuring foundational teaching methods, experiential learning activities, and assessment strategies for adventure technical skills; </p><p>-a CD-ROM with printable lesson plans and supporting materials for each unit that make it easy to print only what you will need in the field; and</p><p>-an overview of the teaching process as it relates to adventure-based activities, including discussions of adventure education theory, learning styles, experiential learning and teaching, and outdoor teaching tips and considerations.</p><p>Edited by nationally known outdoor adventure educators, this book allows you to tap into the knowledge and expertise of skilled instructors who present progressive technical skills for these activities:</p><p>-Backpacking</p><p>-Canoeing</p><p>-Caving</p><p>-Ice climbing</p><p>-Mountain biking</p><p>-Mountaineering</p><p>-Nordic skiing</p><p>-Rafting</p><p>-Rock climbing</p><p>-Sea kayaking</p><p>-Snowshoeing</p><p>-Whitewater kayaking</p><p>Throughout the guide, the expert instructors share insights, best practices, and field-tested lesson plans that help you teach essential skills to new outdoor and adventure enthusiasts.

This book serves as a comprehensive introduction to the children&#39;s film, examining its recurrent themes and ideologies, and common narrative and stylistic principles. Opening with a thorough consideration of how the genre may be defined, this volume goes on to explore how children&#39;s cinema has developed across its broad historical and geographic span, with particular reference to films from the United States, Britain, France, Denmark, Russia, India, and China. Analyzing changes and continuities in how children&#39;s film has been conceived, it argues for a fundamental distinction between commercial productions intended primarily to entertain, and noncommercial films made under pedagogical principles, and produced for purposes of moral and behavioral instruction. In elaborating these different forms, this book outlines a history of children&#39;s cinema from the early days of commercial cinema to the present, explores key critical issues, and provides case studies of major children&#39;s films from around the world.</p><p>Noel Brown lectures in film and media at Liverpool Hope University.

Constructs the Future, 1940&#x2013;1990</h2><p>From 1940 to 1990, Los Angeles rapidly evolved into one of the most populous and influential industrial, economic, and creative capitals in the world. During this era, the region was transformed into a laboratory for cutting-edge architecture. <i>Overdrive: L. A. Constructs the Future, 1940&#x2013;1990</i> examines these experiments and their impact on modern design, reframes the perceptions of Los Angeles&#x2019;s dynamic built environment, and amplifies the exploration of the city&#x2019;s vibrant architectural legacy.<br><br>The drawings, models, and images highlighted in the <i>Overdrive</i> exhibition and catalogue reveal the complex and often underappreciated facets of Los Angeles and illustrate how the metropolis became an internationally recognized destination with a unique design vocabulary, canonical landmarks, and a coveted lifestyle. This investigation builds upon the groundbreaking work of generations of historians, theorists, curators, critics, and activists who have researched and expounded upon the development of Los Angeles. In this volume, thought-provoking essays shed more light on the exhibition&#x2019;s narratives, including Los Angeles&#x2019;s physical landscape, the rise of modernism, the region&#x2019;s influential residential architecture, its buildings for commerce and transportation, and architects&#x2019; pioneering uses of bold forms, advanced materials, and new technologies.<br><br>Los Angeles&#x2019;s ability to facilitate change, experiment, recalibrate, and forge ahead is one of its greatest strengths.

They have not done this out of pure economic zeal. Politics and their own rules and habits explain much of why they have presented globalization as a solution to challenges they have faced in the world economy."&#x2015;from the IntroductionThe greatest success of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank has been as globalizers. But at whose cost? Would borrowing countries be better off without the IMF and World Bank? This book takes readers inside these institutions and the governments they work with. Ngaire Woods brilliantly decodes what they do and why they do it, using original research, extensive interviews carried out across many countries and institutions, and scholarship from the fields of economics, law, and politics.<i>The Globalizers</i> focuses on both the political context of IMF and World Bank actions and their impact on the countries in which they intervene. After describing the important debates between U.S. planners and the Allies in the 1944 foundation at Bretton Woods, she analyzes understandings of their missions over the last quarter century. She traces the impact of the Bank and the Fund in the recent economic history of Mexico, of post-Soviet Russia, and in the independent states of Africa. Woods concludes by proposing a range of reforms that would make the World Bank and the IMF more effective, equitable, and just.</p></p><p>"No other book provides such an elegant introduction to the principal lending operations of both the IMF and the World Bank. With exceptional clarity and grace, Ngaire Woods strikes a balance between analysis and constructive criticism. Her portrait of the contemporary evolution of the policies and practices of the IMF and World Bank seamlessly integrates an impressive range of research and journalistic coverage."--Louis W. Pauly, Director, Centre for International Studies, University of Toronto, author of Who Elected the Bankers?: Surveillance and Control in the World Economy <p>''The Globalizers is an outstanding study of the relationships among the IMF, the World Bank, and their clients. Ngaire Woods presents rich empirical stories and strong analytical insights into the role and mission of these institutions and their relationships. This is a book for those with genuinely open minds about this most complex of subjects.''-Richard Higgott, University of Warwick, coeditor of Global Governance </p><p>"In the new global economy, do the IMF and the World Bank matter anymore? If so, why? Here is vital reading for scholars and practitioners of aid and development on what these institutions do and are meant to do, in addition to what's wrong and what's right about them today. Ngaire Woods is a careful scholar, calling on history, economics, politics, and law, as well as her own extensive interviews, to build a balanced yet compelling case for their reconstitution and revitalization. Anyone interested in what globalization is about should not miss her riveting tales of these global institutions' troubles and small victories in Mexico, Russia, and Africa."--Nancy Birdsall, President, Center for Global Development</p>Ngaire Woods is a Tenured Fellow at University College, Oxford, and Director of the Global Economic Governance Programme at Oxford University.

His work has appeared in many scientific journals and in ANALOG SCIENCE FICTION/SCIENCE FACT magazine. He is the coauthor of COLLEGE PHYSICS, Eleventh Edition and ESSENTIALS OF COLLEGE PHYSICS."I find Serway and Faughn reads the best for students and looks (no kidding, it's important) the best. I like the Quick Quizzes. When I taught this course with previous editions, I almost never used any Conceptual questions because of the difficulty for the students to get much feedback. This was mainly because of the large class size, the wide variation of student ability, and the lack of answers for the students. With the answers to these questions in the back, that changes my position on this."<br><br>"Overall, I like the book. It is colorful, rich, mature, and reliable. There are a wide variety of resources available to the students."<br><br>"I was very happy to find both Newton's Law of Gravitation, and the formula for the period of a simple pendulum, both appearing in this chapter. By and large, I think the presentation in this book of the notions of velocity and acceleration to be quite successful."<br><br>"Your book gives great examples. Would offer no changes to that! The organization of SandF reflects the fact that the authors are (of necessity) physicists; what I mean by this is that the order in which mechanics is presented reflects the way a physicist would think. My opinion remains the same; it is one of the best textbooks at this level."<br><br>"The treatment of friction is excellent."</p><h2>NEARBY HISTORY 3ED:EXPLORING T (American Association for State and Local History)</h2><p>Acclaimed for nearly thirty years as the most comprehensive introduction to research in North American family and community history, and now thoroughly updated, this book is essential for aspiring and practicing public and local historians.</p><p>David E.

Those teaching courses on local history, public history, or research methods would gain the most from Nearby History and should give it serious consideration. (<i>Teaching History: A Journal of Methods</i>)</p><h2>Loose Leaf for Chemistry: Atoms First</h2><p>The Atoms First approach provides a consistent and logical method for teaching general chemistry. This approach starts with the fundamental building block of matter, the atom, and uses it as the stepping stone to understanding more complex chemistry topics. Once mastery of the nature of atoms and electrons is achieved, the formation and properties of compounds are developed. Only after the study of matter and the atom will students have sufficient background to fully engage in topics such as stoichiometry, kinetics, equilibrium, and thermodynamics. Thus, the Atoms First approach empowers instructors to present the most complete and compelling story of general chemistry. Far from a simple re-ordering of topics, this is a book that will truly meet the needs of the growing atoms-first market. The third edition continues to build on the innovative success of the first and second editions. Changes to this edition include specific refinements intended to augment the student-centered pedagogical features that continue to make this book effective and popular both with professors, and with their students.</p><p>Jason Overby received his B.S. in chemistry and political science from the University of Tennessee at Martin, his Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from Vanderbilt University, and conducted postdoctoral research at Dartmouth College.

Blithely unaware of their presence, Emma, who imagines she has a special gift for matchmaking, attempts to arrange the affairs of her social circle with delightfully disastrous results. But when her dear friend Harriet Smith declares her love for Mr. Knightley, Emma realizes she's the one who wants to stay up all night with him. Fortunately, Mr. Knightley has been hiding a secret deep within his unbeating heart-his (literal) undying love for her... A brilliant mash-up of Jane Austen and the undead.</p></p><p><p><b>Wayne Josephson </b>received his BA from Emory University and his MBA from Wharton. After twenty years on Wall Street, he decided to pursue his long-delayed desire to write, becoming a successful screenwriter. <i>Emma and the Vampires </i>is his first novel. He resides with his wife and three children in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>Emma Woodhouse - handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition - had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress her. Until the vampire attacks began. </p><p>Emma resided with her affectionate, indulgent father at their estate, Hartfield, in the village of Highbury. She had been the mistress of the house ever since her sister Isabella's marriage seven years past. Her mother had died too long ago for Emma to have had more than a vague remembrance of her caresses. In her mother's place, an excellent woman named Miss Taylor had served as governess. </p><p>Miss Taylor was less a governess than a friend - their relationship had more the intimacy of sisters. Miss Taylor imposed hardly any restraints on Emma, living together as mutual friends, and Emma doing just what she liked. The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of getting too much her own way and a disposition to think a bit too well of herself. </p><p>These were disadvantages that would lead to dangers which were presently unperceived - everyone in Emma's village was pale, this being England, so the vampire gentlemen of Highbury blended in quite nicely. Emma was blithely unaware when she found herself in their presence. And especially when she found herself attracted to them. </p><p>A gentle sorrow came when Miss Taylor married. The wedding had every promise of happiness for Emma's former governess. Her new husband, Mr. Weston, was a vampire of exceptional character, easy fortune, appealing scent, and eternally suitable age. He had the pale blue-coloured eyes of a vegan who feasted only on animal blood. Emma thought it slightly odd that Mr. Weston requested the wedding be held at midnight. The guests struggled to stay awake, but since Mr. Weston never slept, he was quite alert throughout the ceremony. </p><p>How was Emma to bear the loss of Miss Taylor? With whom would she now share an intimate acquaintance? She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not equal her in conversation, and the disparity in their ages was much increased by his having been a hypochondriac all his life. And with the recent vampire attacks, he was quite fearful of leaving home. </p><p>Emma's sister Isabella, being settled in London sixteen miles off, was much too distant for daily contact. Many a long October and November evening must be endured at Hartfield before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella, her husband, and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant company again. </p><p>Highbury, the large and populous village in which Hartfield was located, afforded Emma no possibility of new friends. The Woodhouses were the grandest family in town. All looked up to them. She had many acquaintances, but not one among them who could be considered a replacement for Miss Taylor. </p><p>It was a melancholy change losing Miss Taylor, and Emma could only sigh over it. But she needed to act cheerful for her father. He was a nervous man, easily depressed, hating change of every kind. He was still not reconciled to his daughter Isabella's marrying, when he now had to part with Miss Taylor too. </p><p>"Poor Miss Taylor! I wish she were here again." </p><p>"But Papa, Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, and excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife. We shall often visit with them. We must pay a dinner visit very soon." </p><p>"But - " </p><p>"What is it, Papa?" </p><p>"My dear, you know how I dread leaving the gates of Hartfield. I just heard of another young lady, a boarder at Mrs. Goddard's school, being murdered by a vampire as she walked home from the village, her blood sucked completely dry." </p><p>"Yes, Papa, that was tragic indeed. I hope in my heart she was not pretty - it would have been such a waste! That makes the third attack in just a few months. It seems no one is safe in Highbury any more. But we would take the carriage to visit the Westons. That would relieve your worry, would it not?" </p><p>"Yes, but - " </p><p>"What is it now, Papa?" </p><p>"It is just that Mr. Weston - he never eats. We shall arrive at dinner and there will be no food to sustain us." </p><p>Emma nodded at her father's wisdom. "Perhaps we ought to visit for tea." </p><p>Her father smiled, and Emma hoped that a game of backgammon might help him through the evening. </p><p>The backgammon table was set up, but before they could commence, Mr. George Knightley paid a call. </p><p>Mr. Knightley was a strikingly handsome vampire who claimed to be thirty-seven but was actually two hundred thirty-seven, with alabaster skin and thick brown hair combed back off his high aristocratic forehead. He had deep purple circles under his eyes from never sleeping. </p><p>A traditional vampire who favoured human blood, Mr. Knightley had not feasted for a great while and thus his eyes were black from need of sustenance. Being a gentleman, of course, he would never consider roaming about at night attacking young ladies to whom he had not been properly introduced. </p><p>Mr. Knightley was not only an intimate friend of the Woodhouse family but an in-law as well - his younger brother John Knightley was married to Emma's sister Isabella. He lived about a mile from Highbury at his estate, Donwell Abbey. Mr. Knightley was a frequent visitor and always welcome at Hartfield - tonight more welcome than usual, having come directly from John and Isabella's house in London to say that everyone was well there. </p><p>His visit this evening cheered Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a reserved but pleasant manner which always did him good. And since his eyes never blinked, he flattered everyone with an uninterrupted gaze. Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk, with so much danger lurking about." </p><p>"Not at all, sir. It is my favourite time of day - a beautiful moonlit night. I now find myself so warm that I must draw back from your great fire." Lest, he thought, I should spontaneously combust into flames. </p><p>"But you must have found your walk very damp. I wish you may not catch cold." </p><p>"Damp, sir!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley. "I thrive in the dampness and cold. The sun quite disagrees with me. And by the by, I have not wished you joy about the wedding. I trust it all went off well. How did you all behave? Who cried the most?" </p><p>"Ah! Poor Miss Taylor!" said Mr. Woodhouse. </p><p>"I should think she would indeed be crying on her nuptial night," said Mr. Knightley, "from the anticipation of the coldness of her new husband's - uh, skin. Well, at any rate, Miss Taylor has been accustomed to having two persons to please, sir - you and Emma. She will now have but one - her husband. It must be better to have only one to please than two." </p><p>"Especially when one of us is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!" said Emma playfully. "That is what you have in your head, I know. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, Papa - it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another." </p><p>Mr. Knightley was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse. In fact, he seemed to possess a strange ability to look into her mind and discern what she was thinking. He was the only one who ever told Emma of her faults. This was not agreeable to Emma - she wanted to be thought of as perfect by everybody. </p><p>"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley. But she also knew how much he cared. On his advice, Emma now carried a wooden stake under her skirt, tied to her leg with a fashionable pink ribbon. Moreover, he instructed her in its proper use, all the while on tenterhooks that she should ever have occasion to employ the weapon against him. "I know that Emma will miss such a companion as Miss Taylor," continued Mr. Knightley, "but she knows how much joy the marriage brings to her former governess."</p></p><h2>United States History: Teacher Edition Beginnings to 1914 2012</h2><p>HOLT MCDOUGAL United States History: Beginnings to 1914 [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>A Beautiful, Terrible Thing: A Memoir of Marriage and Betrayal</h2><p><b>A woman discovers her marriage is built on an illusion in this harrowing and ultimately inspiring memoir.<br><br>&#x201c;Be forewarned: You won&#x2019;t sleep until you finish the last page.<b><i>&#x201d;</i></b>&#x2014;Caroline Leavitt, author of <i>Cruel Beautiful World</i></b><br><br><i>One night.

This man, I knew in my gut, was <i>it.</i> I finally understood what it meant, when you &#x201c;just know.&#x201d; I just knew about Marco. I met him at the Square, the restaurant where we both worked. I got a job as a waitress to make the money that did not seem to be materializing from my acting and modeling careers. Two years out of college, I had quit my job as an analyst at a hedge fund and decided to become a full-time actor, to &#x201c;go for it.&#x201d; It sounded great in theory.</p><p>A year later, I&#x2019;d gone to audition after audition, casting after casting, and the biggest job I had booked was starring in a holiday vodka commercial. The role called for &#x201c;blonde, pretty, aspirational, Swedish-looking.&#x201d; Check, and apparently check, check, check. A whole twenty seconds of staring dreamily into the eyes of the chiseled-faced man I had met a few hours before and clinking my glass against his. Having a restaurant job to pay the bills made me a clich�, but it was necessary, and besides, it gave the days structure.</p><p>On the first day of training at the Square, a trendy burger restaurant a few blocks from my apartment, I sat with ten other new employees around a large, circular table, listening to Bruce, the tiny, energetic manager go over the corporate &#x201c;steps of service.&#x201d; It was my second waitressing job&#x2014;the first, a chain restaurant in midtown (the only place that would hire me with no experience) lasted just two months. As Bruce danced around the restaurant, demonstrating when to bring steak knives versus butter knives to a table, I scanned the faces around the table, landing on dark brown eyes belonging to one of the bartenders. He was tall and Latin with black, slicked back hair and mocha skin. Judging by his accent when he asked a question about the bar setup a few moments earlier, he had been born elsewhere but had lived in the States awhile; the way he spoke was confident and fluid. Our eyes briefly locked and he gave a quick, easy smile. I looked away, willing myself not to blush. I had learned long ago that the best way to survive in New York City was to keep my defenses up at all times. And anyway, I was happy with my long-distance boyfriend back home in Maine. Jeff had light blue eyes, curly brown hair, and a build comprised of the muscles he used every day in his construction job. When I saw him without clothes, it was like seeing a Greek god in the flesh. I had never seen a body like that in real life before. I had met Jeff while I was home for the summer helping my mom recover from surgery. When I went back to New York at the end of the summer, we substituted drunken nights on his couch for hours on the phone, and what was supposed to be a fun summer fling somehow turned into a year-long romance. Our relationship of texting and sporadic weekend visits was easy, and he made me laugh.</p><p>The meeting ended, and I gathered my notebook and pen and slid my sunglasses up to rest on top of my head. I was almost through the doors leading to the street before anyone else had even gotten up from the table. I felt someone come up right behind me and suddenly the door was opening. It was the Latin.</p><p>&#x201c;Jen, right?&#x201d; Except the way he said it, it sounded like &#x201c;Gin.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Um, right. Sorry, I was just&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Marco, the bar manager. Bruce asked me to hand out these employee packets to everyone at the end of the meeting, but you ran away before I could give you one,&#x201d; he said, passing me some rolled up sheets of paper.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sorry, I was just . . . thanks.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t help but meet his open face with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re obviously in a hurry,&#x201d; he said with a wink and then walked away before I could respond.</p><p>The next day at work we did speed drills at the bar to see how quickly the bartenders could churn out drinks during a rush. </p><p>&#x201c;Send three drinks on different tickets, right now, bam, bam, bam,&#x201d; Bruce whispered to me and rubbed his hands together. I put in the order for three drinks.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, a jalape�o margarita for . . . Gin,&#x201d; Marco said as he read the first bar ticket. My face flushed with color. The next ticket printed. &#x201c;And a mojito for . . . Gin,&#x201d; </p><p>Marco said with a half-smile. I smiled back as the third ticket printed. &#x201c;Martini straight up with a twist. Wait. Don&#x2019;t tell me,&#x201d; he scrunched his face up, &#x201c;For Gin!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; I laughed, walking over to the bar. &#x201c;Bruce made me,&#x201d; I whispered when I got close enough.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least I have something nice to look at while I make these drinks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Ha,&#x201d; I said and forced myself to breathe in and out steadily through my nose.</p><p>On the last night of training, before the restaurant opened to the friends and family of the owners the next day, everyone decided to go for a drink at the dive bar two blocks away. I finished my side work and walked to the bathroom to change out of my black&nbsp;uniform.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you coming to Doyle&#x2019;s, Gin?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked up to see Marco walking toward me with his small work duffel bag in hand.&#x201c;Umm . . . yeah. I just have to change.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait for you at the bar. Everyone else already left,&#x201d; he said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, OK . . . I&#x2019;ll be right out.&#x201d; My heart pounded as I quickly pulled on skinny jeans and a loose T-shirt.</p><p>I walked back through the main room of the restaurant. Marco was waiting by the big glass doors.</p><p>&#x201c;After you.&#x201d; Marco held the door open, and we walked through. </p><p>&#x201c;Who said chivalry is dead,&#x201d; I said with a small smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s my Latin charm. It&#x2019;s been bred into me over generations and generations,&#x201d; he said seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, really, is that so?&#x201d; When our shoulders touched for an instant on the way to Doyle&#x2019;s, I momentarily stopped breathing.</p><p>At the bar, we settled in with our coworkers. I sat down next to Andrew, a server with a gleaming bald head and oversize bright white teeth, who immediately began telling me about his relation- ship troubles with his current boyfriend. Marco ordered two vodka sodas and placed one in front of me. &#x201c;Double vodka soda for Gin.&#x201d; His smile swept over me. As he walked to the other side of the table, I thought, <i>I am going to marry that man.</i> It was a quick, involuntary thought, and I recoiled as soon as it had passed through my mind. I took a long drink through the straw in front of me and focused on the cool liquid sliding down my throat.</p><p>For the next hour I talked and joked with Andrew and Karly, another blonde waitress. I&#x2019;d always thought Karly was icy, but after two beers she melted into a sweet, goofy girl from California. Karly confessed she put on a &#x201c;bitch face&#x201d; to fend off advances from the bussers who seemed particularly drawn to her even though she hovered almost a foot above them. I was aware of Marco sitting across the small table from me the entire time, and even though we were both involved in separate conversations, I felt myself speaking every word and making each gesture only for him. As the double vodka soda settled into my bones, loosening my limbs and flushing my cheeks, I pressed my knee into his under the table. For half a second, there was nothing. And then I felt it. A slight returned pressure. Neither of us acknowledged what was happening under the table, and it went unnoticed by all our coworkers.</p><p>When everyone else said their good-byes around 2:00 a.m., I turned to Marco, &#x201c;Are you sure you ordered me a double? It was a little weak.&#x201d; Instead of leaving with the others, he grinned and made his way to the bar saying, &#x201c;In that case, I better get you another drink or you&#x2019;ll leave dissatisfied, and we wouldn&#x2019;t want that.&#x201d; Karly paused at the door, &#x201c;Are y&#x2019;all coming?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, we&#x2019;re gonna have one more. See you tomorrow!&#x201d;</p><p><i>Pull up</i>, a voice whispered in my head. Instead I took a large gulp of the drink Marco had just set in front of me. </p><p>He wanted to know everything about me. There was something about the way Marco looked at me, his eyes were so intense, like I was the only person in the bar. I told him about growing up in a small town on the coast of Maine. My childhood filled with sandy beaches and freezing cold water that gave me ice cream headaches when I dunked (but I always dunked anyway) and playing tag at night with the neighborhood kids. I told him about my parents. How they were the parents that my friends wished were their own parents: affectionate, warm, and funny but also just strict enough. My mom worked her way up the corporate ladder as a manager at L.L.Bean, and my dad was a computer engineer. I told Marco about the moment my dad announced that he had quit his job to start his own company. How, even as an eleven-year-old, I knew it was something special and something to be proud of, but the uncertainty made me nervous. After his first two start-ups failed, we saw less and less of him as he worked longer and longer hours. My mom started getting migraine headaches. There was a tension in our house that had never been there before. And then, after four years and three failed start-ups, my parents brought my sister and me into the dining room and told us to look at the newspaper lying on the kitchen table. The tiny little blurb circled in pen read, &#x201c;Cimaron Snapped up by AMCC.&#x201d; My sister and I shrieked in delight. My father&#x2019;s start-up had been bought by a larger company&#x2014;we were never told the details, but after that morning, the tension in our house dissipated.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not usually in the habit of revealing much about my childhood, but when Marco looked at me, he saw me, who I really was, and my self-consciousness evaporated. His questions came one after another, and, when I got to the part about my long- distance boyfriend, I blushed but plowed on. Marco just smiled and started talking. He told me about growing up in Argentina, about his grandfather&#x2019;s house in the countryside where he would go for the summer and take care of his grandfather&#x2019;s bunnies (only much, much later would he confess that many of those bunnies ended up on their dinner plates), about his trip to the United States with his mother, father, and older sister when he was eighteen. The trip that changed his life. They came for a family vacation after his graduation from military high school. After spending a week in New York City as a tourist who spoke five words of English, he fell in love with the excitement and energy of the city and refused to board the plane back home. It was a split second decision that resulted in a brand-new life in a foreign country and the most exciting city in the world. Then, five years later, when he was just twenty-three and had worked his way up from a busser, to a server, to a bartender, and had become fluent in English, he got his Polish girlfriend pregnant. The girlfriend left him when the baby was a year old, and he had stayed in New York to be close to his son. He had begged her to try to make it work for their new family, but she had already moved on to someone else. She gave him a week to get out of their apartment so her new boyfriend could move in. That was seven years ago.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never told anyone those details before,&#x201d; he said slowly, looking up from his hands.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry. That&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; I reached out and touched his arm.</p><p>I wanted to know everything about him, but in the next moment, he cleared his throat and smiled, &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;re closing up. You better finish your drink.&#x201d;</p><p>I leaned forward to take in the last of the vodka soda through the straw.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do what?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Lean over like that.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down to see cleavage, a lot of cleavage. &#x201c;On that note . . . it&#x2019;s probably time for me to go home.&#x201d;</p><p>Marco walked me home, and we hugged in front of my building. When our bodies pressed together, electricity coursed through my body.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I think you better go inside right now,&#x201d; Marco said with a laugh. </p><p>&#x201c;Because if you don&#x2019;t get out of my sight soon, I might try to kiss you. And I don&#x2019;t want to embarrass myself.&#x201d;</p><p>My cheeks flushed with pleasure. </p><p>&#x201c;Good night, Marco.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good night, Gin.&#x201d; </p></p><h2>Secret Jungle</h2><p><i>Secret Jungle</i> is a photographic record of one woman's determination to reveal the beauties of a vibrant yet endangered world. Nicole Viloteau has spent over twenty-five years exploring the world's jungles, from Gabon to Australia, from Madagascar to Brazil. This book presents a selection of some of the most dramatic encounters and experiences of her travels. Taking the form of simple, poetic, sketches of jungle scenes, Viloteau's text describes the pure emotion experienced traveling alone in the heart of nature. Yet it is the photographs that are the most compelling: vivid close-ups of exotic flowers, almost abstract in their graphic patterns and bold colors, rare tree-frogs and lizards, their skin glistening with poison, snakes with glittering scales and jewel-like eyes.<br><br>The book is divided into thematic chapters, illustrating the remarkable adaptability of jungle flora and fauna and the demands made upon them by their environment. With full-color photographs throughout, <i>Secret Jungle</i> presents a visually stunning world that is vanishing all too quickly.<br></p><p><b>Nicole Viloteau</b>, explorer and photographer, has been uncovering the secrets of the world's remaining jungles for many years. She tamed her first lizard at the age of eight, and has gone on to become an internationally respected herpetologist, devoting her life to the study of reptiles in their natural habitat: from king snakes in the deserts of Northern Australia and vipers in the jungles of Gabon and Madagascar, to the giant dragons of Komodo. It is a passion that has nearly cost her her life on several occasions: she has been bitten on the lip by a rattlesnake and in the thigh by an angry mamba, gored by a buffalo, wounded by poachers, and has survived tropical diseases such as malaria. Yet she returns to the wildest places on earth again and again, fired by her desire to learn more about these creatures that inspire such primal fear and loathing.<br><br>Nicole Viloteau studied Fine Art in Paris and took up photography at the age of twenty. The camera has become an indispensable tool in her research and in her crusade to publicize the plight of the world's few remaining true wildernesses. Featuring reptiles, but also other flora and fauna of the tropics, <i>Secret Jungle</i> is both a showcase for her stunning photographs and a plea for the defense of the rainforest.<br><br>The author has published several bestselling books in her native France.

This is the thesis of these wide-ranging volumes in which internationally leading scholars consider hunter-gatherer peoples in Africa, Asia, Australia and North America and reflect theoretically on the hunter-gatherer condition.Volume 1: Hunters and Gatherers - History, Evolution and Social ChangeVolume II: Hunters and Gatherers - Property, Power and Ideology</p><p>Hunting and gathering peoples in the contemporary world exemplify the human predicament in two radically different ways.

An abundance of black-and-white line drawings are featured to illustrate those stitches, designs, implements, and materials traditionally associated with lace making. Where confusion exists regarding contemporary terminology versus older usage, Stillwell clarifies and provides cross-references. Her dictionary should be as valuable to the beginning student of lace making as it will be to one who is already immersed in any aspect of this fine handwork. <i>Alice Joyce</i>What do fast crossing, parfilage, toad's foot, and Kitty Fisher's eyes have in common? They are all terms used in lacemaking, a centuries-old craft that takes many varied forms and functions worldwide. A well-known lace author and teacher, Stillwell aims to systematize the terminology of netting, tatting, and bobbin, needle, and crochet laces. To achieve her goal, she offers some 2000 concise definitions and more than 800 detailed line drawings, she also cross-references less-used and foreign-language terms.

Today, people around the world face severe and growing water scarcity, and everywhere this vital resource is ceasing to be a right and becoming a commodity. The acequia or irrigation ditch associations of Taos, R�o Arriba, Mora, and other northern New Mexico counties offer an alternative. Few northern New Mexicans farm for a living anymore, but many still gather to clean the ditches each spring and irrigate fields and gardens with the water that runs through them. Increasingly, ditch associations also go to court to defend their water rights against the competing claims brought by population growth, urbanization, and industrial or resort development. Their insistence on the traditional "sharing of waters" offers a solution to the current worldwide water crisis.</p></p><p>Sylvia Rodriguez deftly integrates the daily labor investments in ditch and field maintenance with the deeply embedded religious rituals necessary for the sanctity of the agricultural landscape.....Scrupulous in her documentation of detail ... she places the study in a global arena.... --Vernon Scarborough, 9/16/07<br><br>...a theoretically informed, empirically rigorous, and socially relevant anthropology of water use that overcomes the limits of academic fashion. --Casey Walsh, American Anthropologist, vol. 112, no. 2<br><br>...Rodriguez writes a fascinating account of the interaction of water, faith, and landscape in northern New Mexico.

Such a boost came in the first half of the twentieth century, when an obscure Belgian priest put his mind to deciphering the nature of the cosmos. Is the universe evolving to some unforeseen end, or is it static, as the Greeks believed? The debate has preoccupied thinkers from Heraclitus to the author of the Upanishads, from the Mayans to Einstein. The Day Without Yesterday covers the modern history of an evolving universe, and how Georges Lemaitre convinced a generation of thinkers to embrace the notion of cosmic expansion and the theory that this expansion could be traced backward to the cosmic origins, a starting point for space and time that Lemaitre called &#34;the day without yesterday.&#34; Lemaitre&#39;s skill with mathematics and the equations of relativity enabled him to think much more broadly about cosmology than anyone else at the time, including Einstein. Lemaitre proposed the expanding model of the universe to Einstein, who rejected it. Had Einstein followed Lemaitre&#39;s thinking, he could have predicted the expansion of the universe more than a decade before it was actually discovered.</p><p><b>John Farrell</b> is a Boston-based writer and producer educated at Harvard in English Literature and History of Science. The former director of media at the Carl J. Shapiro Institute for Education and Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Farrell has written for print and online journals such as Salon, National Review, First Things and Tech Central. He has published short fiction and poetry and produced a number of independent videos for education and entertainment.&nbsp; He lives north of Boston.Few people realize that the Belgian scientist Georges Lema�tre (1894&#x2013;1966) played a seminal role in the development of our current understanding of the Big Bang and black holes. Lema�tre was also a Roman Catholic priest, rising to monsignor, but he carefully maintained a firewall between his two vocations, even reacting with horror when Pope Pius XII described the Big Bang as the biblical moment of creation. Science writer Farrell recounts that Einstein dismissed Lema�tre's ideas at their first encounter, in 1927; later, the great man regarded him as a valuable colleague. Lema�tre believed at first that the universe expanded from an initial static state; only later did he arrive at his theory of a "primeval atom," which George Gamow and others developed into the Big Bang theory. Farrell explains how Lema�tre determined that what we now call a black hole is a singularity where the radius of the sphere collapses to zero. Lema�tre also stuck with the cosmological constant after Einstein had abandoned it, a stance validated in the 1990s when scientists discovered that the universe's expansion is accelerating. Science buffs will enjoy this nicely written biography of a little-known but towering figure in modern cosmology.

This book surveys the land and rivers, the people and ideas, that led to this compelling religious architecture; it is also a guide to visiting these churches today.<br><br>In the ninth century the Anasazi, progenitors of the Pueblo peoples, constructed refined architectural complexes at Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon. Contact with the Spanish in the late 1500s transformed the world of these indigenous peoples, changing their agricultural and living patterns&#x2014;as well as religious practices. These changes were manifest architecturally in the sanctuaries the Spanish constructed as missions for the Indians or as parish churches for themselves. First built roughly between 1600 and 1829, but continuing to be rebuilt into this century, they were made of the very materials composing the land itself.<br><br>In Part I, Marc Treib addresses the geographical, anthropological, and architectural aspects of church building in New Mexico and provides background on the church as both an institution and a building type. Part II presents thirty churches in depth and discusses such topics as sitting, construction in adobe and stone, the use of light, ornamentation, and the issues surrounding restoration.<br><br><i>Sanctuaries of Spanish New Mexico</i> is the only book in print to include all the major church sites still extant. Richly illustrated, with specially prepared plans of the churches, it will be welcomed by architectural historians and anyone with an interest in the American Southwest.</p><p><b>Marc Treib</b> is Professor of Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, and the co-author of <i>A Guide to the Gardens of Kyoto</i> (1980).New Mexico's early Spanish churches are among the oldest buildings in the United States. Treib (architecture, Univ. of California, Berkeley) studied existing buildings and bolsters this architectural history/scholarly guidebook by fieldwork and formal analysis. Part 1 outlines environmental conditions, patterns of exploration and settlement by the Spanish, the baroque Spanish church as institution and building type, and its influence on New Mexico's colonial architecture. Part 2 comprises individual chapters on 30 mission churches constructed between the 1620s and the 1820s.

Their delightful films rank alongside the most popular non-English language films ever made, with each new eagerly-anticipated release a guaranteed box-office smash. Yet this highly profitable studio has remained fiercely independent, producing a stream of imaginative and individual animations. The studio&#x2019;s founders, long-time animators Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, have created timeless masterpieces. Although their films are distinctly Japanese their themes are universal&#x2014;humanity, community, and a love for the environment. No other film studio, animation or otherwise, comes close to matching Ghibli for pure cinematic experience. All their major works are examined here, as well the early output of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, exploring the cultural and thematic threads that bind these films together.</p></p><p>Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc&nbsp;are the coauthors of <i>Horror Films</i>, <i>Jackie Chan</i>,&nbsp;<i>John Carpenter</i>, <i>Tim Burton</i>, and <i>Vampire Films</i>, and contributors to&nbsp; <i>Alter Image</i> and <i>The Greenwood Encyclopaedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy</i>.</p><h2>Economics: Principles and Policy</h2><p>ECONOMICS: PRINCIPLES AND POLICY, Twelfth Edition, teaches the principles of economics, including current economic situations, providing an essential resource for faculty and students who want a solid introduction that calls on policy-based information for examples and applications.</p><p>William J.

Alongside more than 350 carefully selected color images of key works, Terry Smith offers the first account of these changes, from their historical beginnings to the present day. Exploring key works by both well known<br>and little-known artists, the author shows how contemporary art achieved definitive force in the markets and museums of the major art centres during the 1980s and then became a global phenomenon as artworlds everywhere began to connect more closely: new communicative technologies and expanding social media are now shaping the future of art.<br> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Contemporary Art: World Currents</i> breaks new ground in tracing how modern, traditional and indigenous art became contemporary in each cultural region of the world, ranging across Western, East and Central Europe, North and South America and the Caribbean, Oceania, Africa, and the Middle East. Terry Smith lays the groundwork for a new comparative approach to contemporary art, emphasizing its relationships to all aspects of contemporary life. He argues that it is cultural diversity and individual artistic inventiveness, not a convergence towards sameness, which makes today&#x2019;s art contemporary.<br> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Contemporary Art: World Currents</i> brings the subject right up-todate, highlighting the concerns of contemporary artists while giving the reader an invaluable insight to art today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Teaching and Learning Experience</b> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <i>Improve Critical Thinking- </i>Explore how contemporary art has become a global, connected phenomenon</p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <i>Engage Students- </i>Looks at the work of contemporary artists from across the world.</p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <i>Support Instructors- </i>Image PowerPoints slides are available for <i>Contemporary Art: World Currents</i>. </p><p> </p> &nbsp;</p><p><p>Terry Smith, FAHA, CIHA, is Andrew W.

According to the National Park Service, city lights as far as 200 miles away diminish views of night skies. So even in a remote field, the sky above may be part of the "sky glow" of the surrounding city or town. Weather might be an issue too, as it is for all skywatchers. Nevertheless, there are many celestial delights to be seen. </p><p> <i>Urban Astronomy</i> shows that nighttime lighting and the resultant brightening of the sky can be combatted and demonstrates how to make the best of poor conditions. Although the unaided eye may be able to pick out only a few hundred stars, binoculars or a small telescope will reveal many times that number. </p><p> A little optical aid can also give you good views of every type of major astronomical object, including star clusters, nebulae and galaxies. For example, there are special filters that let through the light from distant nebulae while blocking out wavelengths infested by unwanted stray light from streetlights. Modern CCDs allow modest amateur telescopes to penetrate the urban sky glow and reveal sights that would have taxed larger instruments 30 years ago. </p><p> The book also covers: </p><ul> <li> How weather and pollution affect observing </li> <li> Specific tips to combat urban streetlighting </li> <li> The best objects to observe from cities and towns </li> <li> Deep-sky objects visible from urban locations in both the northern and southern hemispheres </li> <li> The range of telescopes and accessories for light-polluted skies </li> <li> CCDs and the rebirth of astronomy from cities and towns </li> <li> How to find dark skies. </li> </ul><p></p><p> The book's nine chapters cover the basics of successful urban viewing, its "enemies" -- weather and streetlights -- and explain how to choose viewing targets and arm yourself with the right "weapons and ammunition" to find them. The book also covers indoor astronomy. </p><p> <i>Urban Astronomy</i> is an ideal guide to skywatching while combating light pollution. It will show you how to get the most out of almost any sky. </p></p><p><p> Robin Scagell is a long-serving vice president of Britain's Society for Popular Astronomy. A lifelong stargazer, he has worked as an observer and photographer, and as a journalist has edited a wide range of popular-interest magazines. Robin is the author of several popular astronomy books, and has contributed to many other publications. He often appears on television, commenting on events in space and astronomy, and runs an astronomical picture agency. </p><p>In London's Regents Park, a throng of people gather each month after dark for a star party. They call themselves the Baker Street Irregular Astronomers, after the fictional Sherlock Holmes' gang of local informants, the Baker Street Irregulars. Despite observing in a most unpromising location, they manage to observe a wide range of objects, including deep-sky favorites such as galaxies, planetary nebulae and star clusters. While the views they get of such wonders aren't as good as those from dark-sky sites, they prove the point that city observing is not a waste of time.</p> <p>But this book is not just about observing from the middle of a big city. More amateur astronomers than ever now have to face the problems of light pollution. You may live in the leafy outskirts of a pleasant small town yet still be unable to see the Milky Way. And even well away from the bright lights, light pollution is still evident. You can be in what seems to be a remote country site, with no habitation or artificial lighting visible for miles, but when you try to photograph the Milky Way, for example, the background rapidly turns brown from the lights of cities well beyond your immediate horizon. Even if the sky overhead is black, lower down you see the familiar skyglow.</p> <p>Despite this, amateur astronomy is still as popular as ever, with new technology helping to overcome what the streetlights have robbed from us. And purely visual observers, armed with no more than a telescope, can still enjoy good views by choosing their moment and their targets. Writing for the first edition of this book in 1994, veteran US observer Leif Robinson recalled his first ever observation as a child using a small telescope propped on a staircase: the double star Albireo, with its contrasting yellow and blue hues. The good news is that this delight still awaits observers wherever they live, as do many more.</p> <p>This book is as much for relative newcomers to astronomy as it is for those who have been observing for years. I have had to assume that you are familiar with the basics of observing, so if you don't know what an equatorial mount is, or whether first-magnitude stars are brighter than sixth-magnitude ones, then please look in a more general book. My own <i>Firefly Stargazing with a Telescope</i> covers this, and more.</p> <p>In Chapter 4, I cover observations that you can carry out from light-polluted skies that have a practical use, but the fact is that the vast majority of amateur astronomers observe for fun, cherry-picking the objects that are around, rather than engage in programs of work. You don't have to be a dedicated observer in order to call yourself an amateur astronomer, but around 90 percent of all amateurs probably don't observe regularly or have a particular subject area that they are interested in. If this is you, don't worry -- you're in good company, me included.</p> <p>I hope this book will help you to discover what you can see, and encourage you get out there and look -- or maybe regain the enthusiasm that deserted you when the night sky got brighter. The Universe is still out there and waiting to enthrall you.</p></p><h2>Rethinking Home: A Case for Writing Local History</h2><p>Joseph A. Amato proposes a bold and innovative approach to writing local history in this imaginative, wide-ranging, and deeply engaging exploration of the meaning of place and home. Arguing that people of every place and time deserve a history, Amato draws on his background as a European cultural historian and a prolific writer of local history to explore such topics as the history of cleanliness, sound, anger, madness, the clandestine, and the environment in southwestern Minnesota. While dedicated to the unique experiences of a place, his lively work demonstrates that contemporary local history provides a vital link for understanding the relation between immediate experience and the metamorphosis of the world at large. In an era of encompassing forces and global sensibilities, <i>Rethinking Home </i>advocates the power of local history to revivify the individual, the concrete, and the particular. This singular book offers fresh perspectives, themes, and approaches for energizing local history at a time when the very notion of place is in jeopardy.<br><br>Amato explains how local historians shape their work around objects we can touch and institutions we have directly experienced. For them, theory always gives way to facts. His vivid portraits of individual people, places, situations, and cases (which include murders, crop scams, and taking custody of the law) are joined to local illustrations of the use of environmental and ecological history. This book also puts local history in the service of contemporary history with the examination of recent demographic, social, and cultural transformations. Critical concluding chapters on politics and literature--especially Sinclair Lewis's <i>Main Street </i>and Longfellow's <i>Hiawatha</i>--show how metaphor and myth invent, distort, and hold captive local towns, peoples, and places.</p><p>"<i>Rethinking Home</i> is pioneering scholarship at its best. Amato makes his case for a new local history combining academic sophistication with a deft human touch, that can provide a new perspective on the way in which humans have interacted with their natural and created environments over the past 150 years. Amato&#x2019;s eloquent plea for scholars to rethink the intricate relationships between home, place, nation, and world is one that cannot be ignored."&#x2015;Richard O. Davies, University Foundation Professor, University of Nevada <br><br>"Local history is the stepchild of our profession. Joseph Amato has emancipated Cinderella. Innovative and engaging, his passion for particulars brings life to people and places whose interest we have underrated far too long; and provides a good read beside."&#x2015;Eugen Weber Department of History, UCLA <br><br>"In the best Thoreauvian sense, Joseph Amato masterfully synthesizes and eloquently presents two decades of practicing and thinking deeply about local history. How pleasantly odd, how wonderful that a book on local history should be so rousing, so encouraging, so redemptive! <i>Rethinking Home </i>is a veritable call to arms for those of us who care deeply about the special, the distinctive character of our own home places, our own locales."&#x2015;Bradley P.

Yet the book's anonymous author was more than an inspired storyteller. The author was also an uncannily astute observer of political life and the moral compromises and contradictions that the struggle for power inevitably entails. <i>The Beginning of Politics</i> mines the story of Israel's first two kings to unearth a natural history of power, providing a forceful new reading of what is arguably the first and greatest work of Western political thought.</p><p>Moshe Halbertal and Stephen Holmes show how the beautifully crafted narratives of Saul and David cut to the core of politics, exploring themes that resonate wherever political power is at stake. Through stories such as Saul's madness, David's murder of Uriah, the rape of Tamar, and the rebellion of Absalom, the book's author deepens our understanding not only of the necessity of sovereign rule but also of its costs&#x2015;to the people it is intended to protect and to those who wield it. What emerges from the meticulous analysis of these narratives includes such themes as the corrosive grip of power on those who hold and compete for power; the ways in which political violence unleashed by the sovereign on his own subjects is rooted in the paranoia of the isolated ruler and the deniability fostered by hierarchical action through proxies; and the intensity with which the tragic conflict between political loyalty and family loyalty explodes when the ruler's bloodline is made into the guarantor of the all-important continuity of sovereign power.</p><p><i>The Beginning of Politics</i> is a timely meditation on the dark side of sovereign power and the enduring dilemmas of statecraft.</p></p><p><p>"Though the biblical narrative of Saul and David has been the subject of much literary analysis, Moshe Halbertal and Stephen Holmes illuminate it in a fresh way through their focus on politics. They make a persuasive case that the biblical writer evinces probing insight into the consequences of the pursuit of power, insight that is still relevant to the political constellations of our own era."<b>--Robert Alter, author of <i>Strong as Death Is Love: The Song of Songs, Ruth, Esther, Jonah, and Daniel, a Translation with Commentary</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Beginning of Politics</i> is an unprecedented feat that contributes to biblical scholarship as well as our understanding of politics in general. In particular, in their brilliant unraveling of the relations among David, Uriah, and Joab, Halbertal and Holmes show how the calculations of political rulers may be thwarted by their attempts to hide their intentions and by chains of obedience and violence that escape the control of their initiators."<b>--Jon Elster, Columbia University</b></p><p>"Truly remarkable. The greatness of the Book of Samuel is due in part to its matchless account of politics and political psychology, and there is no better book to bring this account to light than this one."<b>--Avishai Margalit, Hebrew University of Jerusalem</b></p><p>"By treating the author of Samuel as an ancient Machiavelli, Halbertal and Holmes enable readers to approach the biblical story in a new way while enhancing their understanding of the workings of political survival and the dynamics of power."<b>--Steven Weitzman, author of <i>Solomon: The Lure of Wisdom</i></b></p><p>"For Halbertal and Holmes, the author of Samuel is a writer of singular political insight, a brilliant student of politics, and indeed, a political theorist avant la lettre. This is a wonderful discovery. <i>The Beginning of Politics</i> is a work of deep and original scholarship."<b>--Michael Walzer, author of <i>In God's Shadow: Politics in the Hebrew Bible</i></b></p><b>Moshe Halbertal</b> is the Gruss Professor of Law at New York University, the John and Golda Cohen Professor of Jewish Philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and professor of law at IDC Herzliya in Israel.

It analyses the mentalities of domination and subjection - how the English explained and justified their pretensions and how native rulers and societies in Ireland and Wales responded to the challenge. It also explains how the English monarchy came to claim and exercise a measure of &#39;imperial&#39; control over the whole of the British Isles by the end of the thirteenth century, converting a loose domination into sustained political and governmental control. This is a study of the story of the Anglo-Norman and English domination of the British Isles in the round. Hitherto historians have tended to concentrate on the story in each country - Ireland, Scotland and Wales - individually. This book looks at the issue comparatively, in order to highlight the comparisons and contrasts in the strategies of domination and in the responses of native societies.</p><p>This book, a revised and extended version of Professor Davies&#39;s 1988 Wiles Lectures, explores the ways in which the kings and aristocracy of England sought to extend their domination over Ireland, Scotland and Wales in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.</p><h2>The Grammar Bible</h2><p>� 1st Place Winner (Reference Category), PMA's Benjamin Franklin Awards 2000<br> � Each of the 16 chapters closes with a short quiz</p><p></p><h2>Understanding the American Promise, Volume 1: To 1877: A Brief History of the United States</h2><p><br><br>In response to the ever-changing challenges of teaching the survey course, <i>Understanding the American Promise</i> combines a newly abridged narrative with an innovative chapter architecture to focus students' attention on what's truly significant.

His long career established him as one of the most influential philosophers, mathematicians, and social reformers of the twentieth century.</p><h2>A System of Pragmatic Idealism, Volume I: Human Knowledge in Idealistic Perspective (A System of Pragmatic Idealism, Vol. 1)</h2><p><p>With <i>Human Knowledge in Idealistic Perspective</i> the philosopher Nicholas Rescher launches a three-volume series that will synthesize his life's work. Rescher's numerous books and articles, which address almost every major philosophical topic, reflect a unified approach: the combination of pragmatism and idealism characteristic of his thinking throughout his career. Three related but independently readable books will now present Rescher's system as a whole, showing that rather than simply juxtaposing European continental idealism and American pragmatism in a new way, he has created an integrated philosophical position in which the central concepts of these two traditions become a coherent totality. The present initial volume is dedicated to issues of epistemology, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of nature. Its position conforms to the classical structure of idealism in assigning to mind-supplied materials an at least partially determinative role in relation to our standard characterization of the world. Its approach has a teleological character in recognizing the substantial part played by human purpose, but nevertheless represents a middle-of-the-road idealism that makes significant concessions to realism. The second volume of the work will deal with issues of value theory, ethics, and practical philosophy; the third, with the nature of philosophical inquiry itself.</p></p><p></p><h2>Cases and Materials on Trade Secret Law (American Casebook Series)</h2><p>This is the second edition of the first casebook in the United States devoted exclusively to trade secret law. As with the successful first edition, it is challenging yet user-friendly to students in order to facilitate their reading and understanding of the material. It is designed to be used by law students (and business students) with no prior background in intellectual property law.<br><br>Due to the breadth of the subject matter, professors who teach trade secret law need not be intellectual property experts, but can specialize in a variety of fields, including employment law, torts, and unfair competition. The casebook also provides the context to re-teach and reinforce many of the basic concepts of law that students learned as 1L&#x2019;s, including tort law, contract law, property law, civil procedure, constitutional law, and criminal law.<br><br>This new edition includes timely additions relating to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (DTSA) and the EU Trade Secret Directive, two laws that went into effect in mid-2016, and which are certain to change the landscape of trade secret law in the United States and Europe. Unlike the only other existing casebook on the topic, this book continues to focus on and teach the predominant source of trade secret law in the U.S., the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) as interpreted by courts throughout the U.S.<br><br>The authors have made conscious and thoughtful decisions about the way in which the information throughout the casebook is presented and organized. The general organization of the casebook follows a logical analytical approach to understanding trade secret law with the chapters progressing from proving the essential elements of a trade secret claim to defensive tactics and remedies, managing trade secrets, and criminal actions. It also addresses employment, management, and international issues.</p><p></p><h2>Movies and American Society</h2><p><p>The second edition of <i>Movies and American Society</i> is a comprehensive collection of essays and primary documents that explore the ways in which movies have changed&#x2015;and been changed by&#x2015;American society from 1905 to the present.</p> <ul> <li>Each chapter includes an introduction, discussion questions, an essay examining the issues of the period, primary documents, and a list of further reading and screenings</li> <li>Includes a new chapter on &#x201c;American Film in the Age of Terror&#x201d; and new essays for Chapter 9 (&#x201c;Race, Violence, and Film&#x201d;) and Chapter 13 (&#x201c;Hollywood Goes Global&#x201d;), as well as updated Reading and Screenings sections</li> <li>Discusses all the major periods in American film history from the first nickelodeons to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the globalization of Hollywood</li> <li>Demonstrates the unique influence of movies on all aspects of American culture, from ideology, politics, and gender to class, war, and race relations</li> <li>Engaging and accessible for students, with jargon-free essays and primary documents that show social practices and controversies as well as the fun and cultural influence of movies and movie-going</li> </ul></p><p><p>Movies are more than just an evening&#x2019;s entertainment.

Peculiarities of tragic proportions&#x2015;a system of slavery flourishing in a land of freedom, secession and Civil War tearing at a federal Union, deep poverty persisting in a nation of fast-paced development&#x2015;have fed the imaginations of some of our most accomplished historians.<br><br> Foremost in their ranks today is Edward L. Ayers, author of the award-winning and ongoing study of the Civil War in the heart of America, the Valley of the Shadow Project. In wide-ranging essays on the Civil War, the New South, and the twentieth-century South, Ayers turns over the rich soil of Southern life to explore the sources of the nation's and his own history. The title essay, original here, distills his vast research and offers a fresh perspective on the nation's central historical event.</p><p>Edward L. Ayers&#x2019;s The Thin Light of Freedom completes his prize-winning history of the Civil War and its aftermath in the Great Valley that began with In the Presence of Mine Enemies. Ayers&#x2019; superb history has been awarded the Bancroft Prize, the Lincoln Prize, and the Avery O. Craven Award of the Organization of American Historians. A recipient of the National Humanities Medal from President Obama, Ayers is the Tucker-Boatwright Professor of the Humanities and president emeritus of the University of Richmond.According to the late C. Vann Woodward, only irony could unleash the dark and crooked secrets of the American South. One of Woodward's most talented intellectual descendants, Edward L. Ayers, a historian at the University of Virginia, shares the ironic vision, if not the research methods, of his former teacher. In this collection of six essays, two autobiographical pieces (both charming depictions of an awareness of being Southern, here in the United States and abroad) and a reminiscence of Woodward, Ayers rejects the idea of Southern distinctiveness -- no "essences" or "central themes" hold together his version of Southern history. Neither race nor violence, poverty nor religious conservatism, can contain all the elements of the South's story, he contends. The region should not carry the burden of America's original sins, nor the weight of its ultimate redemption, and it cannot be forced into the role of backward neighbor to the modern North.<p>History is messy, undetermined and layered, Ayers maintains; it is made by ordinary people and rooted in changing structures discernible only in the daily records of human life. Woodward, in his 1953 classic, Origins of the New South, stressed politics and economics and found "sharp breaks" in the South's reemergence after the Civil War and Reconstruction. In his essay "Telling the Story of the New South," a revision of Woodward, Ayers treats the same era as a story of interlocking "social phenomena." In their different ways, both writers show us a South revealed through irony, its rich, multiracial and often tragic experience mocking our abiding innocence, our simple faith in progress, our facile optimism. Ayers, author of the prize-winning In the Presence of Mine Enemies: War in the Heart of America, 1859-1863 and The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction, sums up his own method: "I found that the sharp edges of people and their ideas kept poking holes through the conceptual bags and boxes into which we had tried to cram them."</p><p> In lucid prose, Ayers makes a case for what he calls the "deep contingency" of history, the sheer unpredictability of the past, no matter what designs or pleasing narratives we try to encase it in. The core message of this collection comes in two pieces: the title essay, "What Caused the Civil War?," and "Worrying About the Civil War." Both take on what Ayers sees as the new consensus view of the war, exemplified in the grand narrative history of James McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom (1988) and Ken Burns's nine-part PBS documentary film on the war (1990). According to the McPherson-Burns thesis, the Civil War was the inevitable consequence of slavery, fought nobly on both sides and a necessary, if bloody, crucible in which the American nation became "greater through suffering." It is easy to catch Burns succumbing to his epic sensibility, the sentimental drumbeats that demand resolution over complexity. But McPherson is not as easily linked to Burns as Ayers implies. In Battle Cry, as well as in other writings, McPherson does not merely sidestep the "moral problem" of the war, either in its causes or its savagery, and he has weighed in forcefully on the integrity of the postwar Confederate Lost Cause. Ayers does, however, skewer the worst tendencies of the legions of Civil War historians and general enthusiasts. "The war has become common property," he writes, "with the treacherous parts helpfully roped off." And buffs beware. Ayers knows that you "like the current story too much to challenge it" and that you "foreclose questions by repeating familiar formulas." Admit it: Too many people love the Civil War for the wrong reasons.</p><p> Ayers's boldest stroke is his effort to revive the "revisionist" interpretation of the causes of the Civil War made famous in the 1930s and '40s by James Randall and Avery Craven. According to this school, the Civil War was not the result of conflict over fundamental issues like slavery but rooted in the fury born of overwrought party politics and an irresponsible, partisan press. Ayers wants us to revisit this long-repudiated thesis and rescue its best arguments. He would have us fold slavery back into the revisionists' story, chart its path through the political crises of the 1850s and view the "irrational" in political behavior as equal in importance to the economically rational interests of slavery and free labor.</p><p> Ayers is right to remind us that questions about the origins of the Civil War have not all been settled, despite the abundant metaphors of inevitability. And he is persuasive in showing how our focus on black freedom in recent decades has rendered the war retrospectively holy. But he overreaches with the confusing claim that "Southern white men did not fight for slavery; they fought for a new nation built on slavery." His quest for contingency -- historical accident or unpredictability -- is also marred by vagueness when he contends that "all structures must be put into motion and motion into structures." And is it not carrying contingency a bit far to call the Civil War an "extraordinarily unlikely event"? Moreover, Ayers's willingness to blame the war on the "political system itself," a "machinery" that "created controversy," may leave us wondering once again whether Free-Soilers and slaveholders actually believed anything. The argument for contingency is admirable, but "rationality" and "predictability" are not identical concepts.</p><p> The volume also includes a salutary warning, titled "Exporting Reconstruction," about how blithely Americans have ventured into foreign occupations without understanding the first great occupation in their own history. In this clear-eyed account of how the Reconstruction era has become the "Bermuda Triangle of American history, a place where we lose our bearings," Ayers plays the social scientist, suggesting 10 lessons contemporary policymakers might draw from Reconstruction. Any reader confronting these lessons will surely think of the present misadventure in Iraq. Four are especially applicable: Memories of war collapse into memories of the sufferings that follow for the vanquished; reconstructions tend to become revolutions and counterrevolutions; the clock is always ticking, and reconstructions are a "race between change and reaction"; and "freedom" is an ill-defined, mercurial ideal that deserves great care in its rhetorical use.</p><p> Ayers's call to revive a "tradition of skepticism" in Civil War scholarship is valuable and challenging. Those who would "protect" the war from exposure of its dark, ugly underbelly do not serve the ends of either good history or an informed civil society. Ayers's new revisionism would "focus on the way we relate the Civil War rather than on matters of interpretation alone." By that he must mean focusing on the war's ever-evolving public memory. If so, he has taken us to the subject he does not name but effectively implies -- the genuine sense of tragedy at the heart of the war, a subject always integral to Woodward's understanding. As Ayers says, "Movies and books that tell of Americans killing more than six hundred thousand other Americans" should not merely "convey a sense of . . . greatness." </p><p>Reviewed by David W.

The French turned them over to the Gestapo, who imprisoned them. Dudach was executed by firing squad in May; Delbo remained in prison until January 1943, when she was deported to Auschwitz and then to Ravensbruck, where she remained until the end of the war. This book - Delbo&#39;s profoundly moving vignettes, poems, and prose poems of life in the concentration camps and afterward - is a memoir of great literary value. It is a unique document by a female resistance leader, a non-Jew, and a remarkable writer who transforms the experience of the Holocaust into spare, austere, yet lyric prose.</p><p>In1942, Charlotte Delbo (1913^-85) and her husband were arrested in their Paris apartment, where they were preparing to distribute anti-German leaflets. He was executed, and she was deported first to Auschwitz and then to the Ravensbruck concentration camp. <i>Auschwitz and After</i>, first published in France as three separate books (<i>None of Us Will Return</i>, <i>Useless Knowledge</i>, and <i>The Measure of Our Days</i>), is a memoir about her experiences in the camps. Delbo, a non-Jew, recounts the daily struggle to stay alive while besieged with hunger, thirst, abuse, fatigue, and despair. She also relates the recollections of survivors of her own work group and their difficulties in returning to a normal life, as well as her return to France after her liberation. A small portion of the memoir is written in the form of poetry. Holocaust scholar Lawrence Langer has written a penetrating introduction to this masterpiece, in which he says that Delbo writes "not as a heroine but as a victim. Her language is exquisite, but the pain of her memories is not, and this may help to explain why her audience has never been very large." Finally translated into English, this unique memoir will be able to reach the larger audience that it deserves. <i>George Cohen</i>Working for the French Resistance, Delbo was arrested by the Nazis in 1942, imprisoned, and later sent to Auschwitz and Ravensbruck. A talented writer, she sought to preserve a record of the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis. This volume contains a trilogy: "None of Us Will Return" (written in 1946 but not published until 1965), "Useless Knowledge," and "The Measure of Our Days," originally published in 1970. Her writing is haunting, gracefully combining vignettes of poetry and poetic prose and enveloping the reader in an emotional whirlwind. There is a deceptive simplicity inherent in her understated but exceedingly powerful imagery. Lamont's translation is unusually sensitive and fluid, while Lawrence Langer's penetrating introductory essay provides both background material and a deserved tribute to the author.

I tried to follow the &#x201c;three easy steps&#x201d; but I feel like one important step is missing. </p> <p>Step 0.5: Don&#x2019;t put QR code behind GIANT BAR</p> <p>The code is unscannable. It&#x2019;s taking up valuable space, looking fancy and modern, and doing absolutely nothing. This is my main issue with QR codes and so many of the things we try in business - they just don&#x2019;t work. We need to be thinking about functionality for our customers. Did you know that 50% of people who scan a QR code would never scan one again? You know why? Because they didn&#x2019;t work. They didn&#x2019;t bring value. They made people jump through an unnecessary and all to often non-functioning hoop.</p> <p>Stop it.</p> <p><b>Those Poor Kittens</b></p> <em> </em> <p>Step 1. Put QR code on door</p> <p>Step 2. Make the code small enough that people need to get really close to scan it.</p> <p>Step 3. As they approach, have the door automatically open into the person.</p> <p>Step 4. Profit...</p> <p><b>Where QR Codes Belong</b></p> <em> </em> <p>Twenty years ago, QR codes were created for manufacturers. They were better options than bar codes when a lot of information needed to be shared.</p> <p>They are still used for this purpose in many industries today.</p> <p>So, if you see a QR code in your toilet, that&#x2019;s exactly where it belongs.</p><p><b>The kittens are counting on you.</b></p> <p>If you knew that your terrible business decisions could cost a kitten its life, would you still do it? Of course not. No one wants to hurt a kitten, and no one wants to damage their own business through easily avoidable mistakes. But the trick is knowing which things are the wrong things to do.</p> <p>Experts are constantly telling us how to improve our businesses. Hundreds of books on the market are filled with advice from these experts. But how can you filter out all of the bad advice, misinformation, and misuse of business tools that's waiting for you out there? None of us needs another list of what we should be doing. <b>QR Codes Kill Kittens</b> tells you what not to do--with advice that's easy to digest on mistakes that are easy to avoid.</p> <p>It's like a picture book for the fed-up.</p> <p>Using real-life examples from human resources, marketing, branding, networking (in person and online), public relations, and customer service, <b>QR Codes Kill Kittens</b> offers tips and guidance on how to prevent slip-ups such as: </p> <ul> <li>Using QR codes, and other bright and shiny technologies, because you can, and not because you should</li> <li>Insulting, ignoring, and generally avoiding those "pesky" customers</li> <li>Trying to profit from world events, disasters, and other self-interested social media practices</li> <li>Thinking we can automate authenticity</li> <li>Focusing on what's next, instead of working on fixing what you're doing now</li> <li>And so many more cringe-worthy errors in judgment</li> </ul> <p>It doesn't do you any good to do a few things right and a lot of things wrong.

Clay Smith, Jr., focus on the Detroit riots of the 1940s and 1950s, one of the most important periods of Marshall's life, culminating in his arguments before the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education and Bolling v. Sharpe, which in 1954 struck down <i>de jure</i> segregation in public education. Throughout the materials from the next four decades, Marshall comes to life as a teacher, leader, and strategist, explaining, preaching, and cajoling audiences to stand up for their rights. The addresses collected by Smith present a less formal picture of Marshall, from which one can learn much about the depth of his skills and strategies to conquer racism, promote democracy, and create a world influenced by his vision for a just and moral society. </p><p><i>Supreme Justice</i> reveals Marshall as a dogged opponent of unequal schools and a staunch proponent of the protection of black people from violence and the death penalty. Through his own words we see the genius of a man with an ability to inspire diverse crowds in clear language and see him also demonstrate his powers of persuasion in formal settings outside the court. His writings not only enhance our understanding of his groundbreaking advocacy in law and social conflicts, they reveal the names of men and women of all races who made significant contributions leading to Brown v. Board of Education and beyond.</p></p><p>J. Clay Smith, Jr. (1942-2018) was Professor of Law at Howard University and author of Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer, 1844-1944, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>The 1990s</p><p>Justice Marshall's nonjudicial opinions and writings slowed owing to ill health during the early 1990s. In 1992, however, Justice Marshall gave a rare interview to the <i>American Bar Association Journal</i> covering a wide range of topics. During the interview, conducted by Gary A. Hengster, publisher of the journal, Marshall acknowledged his mentor Charles Hamilton Houston and reaffirmed that at Howard University School of Law, Houston had taught "that we be social engineers rather than lawyers . . . and I had early decided that's what I wanted to do."</p><p>Marshall addressed questions concerning racism in the military during World War II and suggested that the Supreme Court had wrongly decided <i>City of Richmond v. Croson</i>, which struck down as unconstitutional economic affirmative action enhancements for minorities. Marshall commented that it was his view that "a state or city can give its citizens more than our Constitution provides. . . . In Croson, this Court held that the Constitution prevented it. I can't believe that."</p><p>In a speech delivered on September 6, 1990, before the Annual Judicial Conference of the Second Circuit, Marshall asserts his belief that "the most important institutional mission of the judiciary [i]n or out the governmental scheme . . . must be a detached independent judiciary that has the final legitimate authority to ensure that political majorities, caught up in the passions of the moment, do not trample the rights of minorities." This statement may be interpreted indirectly critical of the direction of the Supreme Court decisions bowing to political winds that either did not support minority concerns or were intent on turning back the clock on civil rights gains, or both.</p><p>Six months before Justice Marshall died, he received the Medal of Liberty in Philadelphia on July 4, 1992. Upon receiving this prestigious award, he remarked that if America believes that on the "racial side that we have accomplished everything, I feel obliged to tell you that it is not so." Thus, near the end of seven decades of fighting against racism and near the end of his rich life, Marshall was inclined to see the nation as it was, still trapped by divisions of racism. Justice Marshall remarks were not bitter, but marked by disappointment. Despite his seventy years as an advocate for the rights of his people and other disenfranchised minorities of the nation, the goal of liberty for all was still some ways off, though not out of reach.</p><p>The legacy of Thurgood Marshall takes many forms. When he announced his retirement from the Supreme Court, he was asked how he would characterize his legacy. He answered, "I don't know what legacy is left. That's up to the people . . ."</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>We Must Dissent [excerpted]</p><p>[One of Justice Marshall's last public statements prior to his retirement was on July 4, 1992, when he received the Medal of Liberty in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.]</p><p>What I'd like to do is share a few stories, a few anecdotes of people who actually have understood the meaning of liberty and struggle against the odds to become free.</p><p>I think of these people because of the risks that they have taken and the courage they have displayed. You know when I was trying these cases in the South, the people, the local people whom I represented, stayed there and faced the other side, and the dangers. And they were not afraid. They stayed there.</p><p>Well, you know what I did? When the case was over, I'd get the fastest thing out of there. So I want at all times to recognize those who stayed there. I value them not only because of the kind of people they were, but because of the kind of nation they insisted we become. I respect them not because of the influence they wielded, but because of the power they seized. It is useful, I think, to recall their stories, not to dwell on the past, but to see concrete evidence of what was in order to gain the inspiration for what can be.</p><p>Do you remember Heman Marion Sweatt? He was an ordinary person, but he had an extraordinary dream to live in a world which Afro-Americans and Whites alike were afforded equal opportunity to sharpen their skills and to hone their skills, to sharpen their minds. Unfortunately, officials at the University of Texas Law School did not share his vision. Constrained by the shackles of prejudice, incapable of seeing people, and seeing them for what they were, they denied Herman Marion Sweatt admission to the Law School of the University of Texas, as you will remember, solely because of his color&#x2014;the color which just didn't happen to be theirs, a little more sunburned.</p><p>It was a devastating blow and a stinging rejection, a painful reminder of the chasm that separated the white from the Negro. But Heman Sweatt held on to what racism tried to snuff out, a sense of self, and a recognition of place, a determination to obtain the best, and a refusal to settle for anything else. Heman Marion Sweat knew what the white segregationists tried to forget that none of us, Afro, White or Blue will ever rest until we are all truly free.</p><p>Heman Sweat did not pursue liberty alone. Just a few years earlier a couple named Shelley tried to do what the white Americans had done for years, live in a decent neighborhood, in the neighborhood of their choice. But to white homeowners in Missouri such audacity was too threatening to be tolerated, in their view. The Whites belong in one world, because Negroes were in another, and they could not see the similarities that linked them to the Shelly's&#x2014;the common desire to earn a living, to raise children, to own and care for a home. They saw only difference. I guess to them if the United States was indeed a melting pot, the Negro either didn't get into the pot, or he certainly never got melted down. Whatever the reason for myopic vision, the Shelly's were forced to do whatever Negroes had to do for years&#x2014;use the only weapon they had, their right to a day in court to gain the rights to which they were constitutionally entitled.</p><p>Fortunately for our history, the Shelly's won their suit, but even if they had lost, they would have known more freedom than the Whites who tried to shut them out should ever know.</p><p>Racism separates, but it never liberates. Hatred generates fear, and fear, once given a foothold, binds, consumes, and imprisons. Nothing is gained from prejudice. No one benefits from racism.</p><p>As I think back on these courageous people who came before, I wonder what becomes of the challenge the Sweats and the Shelly's provided. They worked for liberty. They fought for freedom. They insisted upon justice. They were optimistic, as I was, that racial interaction would lead to understanding, and in turn would produce healing and redemption. They were hopeful, as I was that America would grow toward justice and expand toward equality. </p><p>Who would have thought that in the wake of Smith against Allright, and Shelley against Karma, and Brown against the Board of Education, that I would be giving a talk now on the anniversary of our nation's independence? I would have predicted that I would have spoken with much pride and optimism of the enormous progress this nation has already made. But as I survey the world Heman Marion Sweat and the Shelly's left behind, I wish I could say that racism and prejudice were only distant memories. I wish I could say that this nation had traveled far along the road to social justice and that liberty and equality were just around the corner. I wish I could say that America had come to appreciate diversity and to see and accept similarities.</p><p>But as I look around, I see not a nation of unity, but a nation of division: Afro and White, indigenous and immigrant, rich and poor, educated and illiterate. Even many educated white people and successful Negroes have given up on integration, and lost hope in equality. They see nothing in common, except the need to flee, as fast as they can, farther from our inner cities.</p><p>A Pullman porter once told me when I was a kid that he had been in almost every city in the country. He said he never was in a city where he had to put his hand in front of his face to know he was a Negro. Well, I'm afraid that I've been in every city in this country, and it's thirty or forty years after what he said. And I hate to tell you, what he said is still true.</p><p>But there's a price to be paid for division and isolation as the recent events in California indicate. Look around. Can't you see the tension in Watts, California? Can't you feel the fear in Scarsdale? Can't you sense the alienation in Simi Valley? The despair in the South Bronx and Brooklyn? It's all around you. We cannot play hostage. Democracy just cannot flourish amid fear. Liberty cannot bloom with hate. Justice cannot take root amid fear.</p><p>America must get to work. In the chilled climate in which we live, we must go against the prevailing winds. We must dissent from the indifference. We must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from the fear, the hatred, and the mistrust. We must dissent from a nation that buried its head in the sand waiting in vain for the needs of its poor, its elderly, and its sick to disappear and just blow away. We must dissent from a government that has left its young without jobs, education, or hope. We must dissent from the poverty of vision and timeless absence of moral leadership. We must dissent, because America can do better, because America has no choice but to do better.</p><p>The legal system can force open doors, and sometimes-even knock down walls, but it cannot build bridges. That job belongs to you and me. The country can't do it. Afro and White, rich and poor, educated and illiterate, our fates are bound together. We can run from each other, but we cannot escape each other. We will only attain freedom if we learn to appreciate what is different, and muster the courage to discover what is fundamentally the same. America's diversity offers so much richness and opportunity. Take a chance, won't you? Knock down the fences, which divide. Tear apart the walls that imprison you. Reach out. Freedom lies just on the other side. We shall have liberty for all.

Beginning with the earliest attempts to heal the body and account for the meaning of illness in the ancient Near East, historian Gary B.

Religious perspectives have informed both the treatment of disease and the provision of health care. And, while tensions have sometimes existed, relations between medicine and religion have often been cooperative and mutually beneficial. </p><p>Religious beliefs provided a framework for explaining disease and suffering that was larger than medicine alone could offer.

How do actual lived childhoods connect with theories about child development? In this completely revised and updated edition, <em>Deconstructing Developmental Psychology</em> interrogates the assumptions and practices surrounding the psychology of child development, providing a critical evaluation of the role and contribution of developmental psychology within social practice. </p> <p>In the decade since the first edition was published, there have been many major changes. The role accorded childcare experts and the power of the 'psy complex' have, if anything, intensified. This book addresses how shifts in advanced capitalism have produced new understandings of children, and a new (and more punitive) range of institutional responses to children. It engages with the paradoxes of childhood in an era when young adults are increasingly economically dependent on their families, and in a political context of heightened insecurity. The new edition includes an updated review of developments in psychological theory (in attachment, evolutionary psychology, theory of mind, cultural-historical approaches), as well as updating and reflecting upon the changed focus on fathers and fathering. It offers new perspectives on the connections between Piaget and Vygotsky and now connects much more closely with discussions from the sociology of childhood and critical educational research. Coverage has been expanded to include more material on child rights debates, and a new chapter addresses practice dilemmas around child protection, which engages even more with the "raced" and gendered effects of current policies involving children.</p> <p>This engaging and accessible text provides key resources to inform better professional practice in social work, education and health contexts. It offers critical insights into the politics and procedures that have shaped developmental psychological knowledge. It will be essential reading for anyone working with children, or concerned with policies around children and families. It was also be of interest to students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels across a range of professional and practitioner groups, as well as parents and policy makers.</p></p><p><p><strong>Erica Burman</strong> is Professor of Psychology and Women&#x2019;s Studies at Manchester Metropolitan University. She is an internationally renowned researcher, teacher and activist, as well as group analyst, bringing critical methodological and interpretive resources for the re-evaluation of the uses of developmental psychology in health and educational contexts and social policy. Her work supports critical and reflexive professional practice with and for women and children.</p><p><em>"This book by Erica Burman is lucid work."</em> <strong>&#x2013; Conchi San Martin in <em>Feminist Review</em></strong></p> <p>"<em>I think this book would make a challenging text for senior undergraduate and postgraduate courses that examine notions of development in psychology, counselling, social work, international development studies or education</em>." <strong>- Lise Bird Claiborne, University of Waikato, New Zealand, in <em>Feminism &amp; Psychology</em></strong></p> <p>"<em>This book is a powerful text in unearthing oppressive discourses, constructing knowledge in a way that promotes the interests of the oppressed whilst equipping the reader with not only a critical education, but also with new, less problematic, ways to engage with the world beyond the book</em>." <strong>- Br�na Nic Giolla Easpaig &amp; David Fryer, Charles Sturt University, NSW, Australia, in <em>Forum</em>: <em>Qualitative Social Research</em></strong></p> <p>"<em>This accessible book is essential reading</em>." <strong>&#x2013; Yvette Solomon in <em>Gender and Education</em></strong></p> <p>"<em>I would recommend this book for all those who work in developmental psychology, as well as parents who may also find many helpful, reassuring reflections</em>."<strong> &#x2013; Belinda Medhurst in <em>Educational Psychology in Practice</em></strong></p> <p>"<em>This completely revised new edition raises many new and compelling questions about the ways in which "experts" have tried to "understand" children.

Every aspiring scholar of childhood should be required to read this book</em>."<strong> - Radhika Viruru, Texas A&amp;M University</strong></p> <p><em></em></p> <p>"<em>This book brings into clear focus how history, geography, culture and politics have shaped the concerns and concepts of developmental psychology and produced powerful, often oppressive, effects for children.

A book to provoke, debate and inspire other ways to know and be with children</em>." <strong>- Professor Glenda Mac Naughton, Director of the Centre for Equity and Innovation in Early Childhood, Faculty of Education at the University of Melbourne.</strong></p> <p><em></em></p> <p>"<em>This book is a vital resource for all who are engaged in trying to deconstruct and border cross the hegemonic role of developmental psychology in the field of early childhood education and childhood studies. Due to the author&#x2019;s own impressive familiarity both with the field, but also with discourses outside the field, it has been possible to identify and evaluate what is taken for given in the field. What makes the book particularly compelling is the effort to bring in historical accords in relation to the new geopolitical situation</em>." <strong>- Gunilla Dahlberg, Professor of Early Childhood Education, Stockholm Institute of Education, Stockholm, Sweden</strong></p> <p><em></em></p> <p>"<em>This version is even better than the first, with new, contemporary, compelling examples of the social-political context of developmental psychology.&nbsp; Burman is critical yet positive, bold yet thoughtful, provocative yet balanced, and deconstructive yet constructive.

Miller, Ph.D., Professor and Head, Dept. of Psychology, University of Georgia</strong></p> <p><em></em></p> <p>"<em>The first edition of this book was cutting edge and visionary in its sustained, critical analysis of developmental psychological theories and assumptions.

David Pletcher describes the trade of the United States with the Far East, the islands of the Pacific, and the northwest coast of North America from 1784 (the year of the first American trading expedition to China) to 1844 (the year of the first trade treaty with China, followed immediately by the U.S. acquisition of Oregon and California). He then traces the growth of trade and investment in Alaska, Hawaii, and the South Pacific from 1844 to 1890 and proceeds to do the same for China, Japan, and Korea. In the ensuing chapters, Pletcher covers the 1890s, including the annexation of Hawaii, the Sino-Japanese War, the acquisition of the Philippines, and the Open Door policy in China.</p><p>He concludes that the American expansion across the Pacific and into the Far East was not a deliberate, consistent drive for economic hegemony but a halting, experimental, improvised movement, carried out against determined opposition and indifference and dotted with setbacks and failures. Providing his own judgments about the wisdom and effectiveness of America's new endeavors, Pletcher summarizes the problems and handicaps involved, demonstrating that errors of the twentieth century were at least partly the result of poor preparation in the 1880s and 1890s.</p><p>Touching on every place where Americans undertook significant economic activity, <i>The Diplomacy of Involvement</i> will be an important aid for seasoned scholars, as well as an excellent introduction for the novice.</p></p><p><p>David M. Pletcher is Professor Emeritus of History at Indiana University in Bloomington. He is the author of many books, including <i>The Diplomacy of Trade and Investment: American Economic Expansion in the Hemisphere, 1865-1900</i> (University of Missouri Press).</p><p>"An excellent work of historical scholarship. A good companion to his earlier work, <i>The Diplomacy of Trade and Investment: American Economic Expansion in the Hemisphere, 1865- 1900.</i> It is well-organized, clearly written, thoroughly researched, and subtly argued.

Taking into account new debates on the progress of the English Reformation and the strengths and weaknesses of Tudor Government at a local and national level, the book includes contextual analyses of the Tudor English economy, society, and political culture.</p><p>Tudor England is a compelling account of political and religious developments from the advent of the Tudors in the 1460&#39;s to the death of Elizabeth I in 1605.John Guy is Reader in History at the University of Bristol and was John Hinkley Visiting Professor at the Johns Hopkins University (1989-90).

Intended for use in one- or two-semester courses on Schenkerian theory, this text will also appeal to individuals interested in Schenker's work. The book assumes no prior knowledge of the subject, but it does require a background in harmony and voice leading; a familiarity with species counterpoint is also desirable. The authors develop Schenkerian techniques through the practical analysis of specific compositions, an approach that parallels the evolution of Schenker's work. The book explains structural principles in actual composition rather than through models and formulas, and teaches students how to think about and critically examine compositions in ways that will inform their understanding and performance of great compositions of Western art music. <br> The first part of the volume provides the foundation for the analysis of complete pieces and includes chapters on melody, bass-line structures, linear techniques, and the essential properties of the <em>Ursatz</em> and its basic elaborations; the presentation of complete compositions in Part II is organized by formal category. The concluding chapter summarizes the main theoretical issues of Schenker's approach. The book includes over 200 analytical graphs, musical examples, and a bibliography. <em>Analysis of Tonal Music: A Schenkerian Approach</em> provides a unique and accessible introduction to Schenkerian analytical ideas and shows how they can be applied toward a better understanding of tonal music.</p><p>Allen Cadwallader is at Oberlin College Conservatory of Music.

After the Holocaust, Soviet repression, and American assimilation, the survival of traditional Yiddish literature depends on translation, yet a few Yiddish classics have been translated repeatedly while many others have been ignored. Anita Norich traces historical and aesthetic shifts through versions of these canonical texts, and she argues that these works and their translations form an enlightening conversation about Jewish history and identity.</p><p><b>Anita Norich </b>is professor of English and Judaic studies at the University of Michigan."<i>Writing in Tongues</i> is sophisticated yet wholly accessible, completely engaging, and beautifully written.

As the narrative follows the Institute for Social Research from Frankfurt am Main to Geneva, New York, and Los Angeles, and then back to Frankfurt, Wiggershaus continually ties the evolution of the school to the changing intellectual and political contexts in which it operated. He also interweaves these accounts with incisive summaries of substantive works by Horkheimer, Adorno, Benjamin, Fromm, Kirchheimer, Lowenthal, Marcuse, Neumann, Pollock, and Habermas.The book is self-contained and can serve as a general introduction to critical theory, but it also has a wealth of new material to offer those who are familiar with this tradition but would like to learn more about its history and context.Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought</p></p><p>Rolf Wiggershaus is an independent scholar living in Frankfurt.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>A Book of Remembrances: Diana, Princess of Wales 1961-1997</h2><p>Presents highlights from the public and private life of the late Princess of Wales</p><p></p><h2>Ethics in Sport - 2nd Edition</h2><p><p>The latest edition of <i>Ethics in Sport</i> doesn't rest on its laurels as the finest and most comprehensive collection of literature to date on moral and ethical issues confronting sport in contemporary society.

She shows how Hawthorne's idea of citizenship emerged from an attempt to adjudicate among the official and the popular, the national and the local, the collective and the individual, utopia and history.<br> <br> At the core of Berlant's work is a three-part study of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, analyzing the modes and effects of national identity that characterize the narrator's representation of Puritan culture and his construction of the novel's political present tense. This analysis emerges from an introductory chapter on American citizenship in the 1850s and a following chapter on national fantasy, ranging from Hawthorne's early work "Alice Doane's Appeal" to the Statue of Liberty. In her conclusion, Berlant suggests that Hawthorne views everyday life and local political identities as alternate routes to the revitalization of the political and utopian promises of modern national life.<br></p></p><p><b>Lauren Berlant</b> is the George M.

They were probably the first animal species to become domesticated, but their relationship with humans has always been ambivalent. Dogs form strong attachments to humans, even in the face of rejection and punishment, voluntarily allying themselves to us as faithful companions, uncomplaining child-substitutes, enduring workers, and excellent hunters and guards. Yet they are also reviled as vicious killers, unclean scavengers and outcasts. In this book, the many facets of dog behavior are set in the context of the dog&#39;s place in our society. Based on firm scientific research, the book dispells many myths and stereotypes about our canine friends, and it will be the definitive reference work on dog behavior for many years to come. Dog-lovers with an interest in understanding how and why dogs behave as they do will find this fascinating reading.</p><p>This unique book provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art account of the domestic dog&#39;s natural history and behaviour based on scientific and scholarly evidence rather than hearsay. Anyone with a serious interest in Canis familiaris, its evolution, behaviour, and its place in our society will find The Domestic Dog an indispensable and fascinating resource.This unique book seeks to expose the real dog beneath the popular stereotypes. Its purpose is to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art account of the domestic dog&#39;s natural history and behaviour based on scientific and scholarly evidence rather than hearsay.</p><h2>Laws of Markets</h2><p>With the collapse of the planned economies of Eastern Europe, the market is extending its reach and at the same time claiming its universal applicability.</p><p>With the collapse of the planned economies of Eastern Europe, the market is extending its reach and at the same time claiming its universal applicability. But this is occurring while paradoxically it is becoming more difficult to define &#34;the market&#34;. The authors, all outstanding scholars in the booming field of socio-economics, explore how concrete markets are built up and stabilized. They give answers to questions such as the following: How are entities, material or non material, human or non human, transformed into commodities? How are economic behaviours shaped by institutional arrangements? Is it possible to characterize the role of the social sciences and in particular of economics in performing markets and in enforcing rational behaviours?</p><h2>The Little Mermaid and Other Stories (Danish/English Texts) (Danish Edition)</h2><p>H.

First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Its main challenger, liberalism, looks to Kant and nineteenth-century economists. Despite their many insights, neither realism nor liberalism gives us adequate tools to grapple with security globalization, the liberal ascent, and the American role in their development. In reality, both realism and liberalism and their main insights were largely invented by republicans writing about republics.</p><br><p> The main ideas of realism and liberalism are but fragments of republican security theory, whose primary claim is that security entails the simultaneous avoidance of the extremes of anarchy and hierarchy, and that the size of the space within which this is necessary has expanded due to technological change.</p><br><p> In Daniel Deudney's reading, there is one main security tradition and its fragmentary descendants. This theory began in classical antiquity, and its pivotal early modern and Enlightenment culmination was the founding of the United States. Moving into the industrial and nuclear eras, this line of thinking becomes the basis for the claim that mutually restraining world government is now necessary for security and that political liberty cannot survive without new types of global unions.</p><br><p> Unique in scope, depth, and timeliness, <i>Bounding Power</i> offers an international political theory for our fractious and perilous global village.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Bounding Power</i> has the potential to revolutionize international political thought.

Includes a step-by-step program for establishing good sleep habits and individualized guidelines from infancy throughout the growing years.</p><p>I read this book when my second child was born last fall. My first baby was a terrible sleeper, and I was determined not to go through that same nightly hell -- rocking, singing, walking, coddling for hours only for her to wake up when I finally placed her in the crib. So, with my son, I decided to be prepared. And Dr. Weissbluth's methods were amazing. Who knew that babies would actually like to go to sleep early? By watching my son's moods, I learned that he really needed more evening sleep, and two lengthy naps, one in mid-morning and another in early afternoon. Bedtime at 7:30 and he sleeps until 6:00 am! He's happy, energetic and bright. I'm truly convinced that if I had tried to go through the "crying to sleep" method again (my husband and I did attempt it with my first kid, but found it absolutely agonizing), we would have all had a miserable few months. <br><br>Now I know why the good doctor gets phone calls from all over the U.S. asking for advice. He is one of the leading pediatric sleep researchers in the country, and is frequently consulted by top parenting and child care magazines.<br><br>I'm so utterly devoted to this book, that I'm happy to announce Dr. Weissbluth will be updating the research in a new edition of HEALTHY SLEEP HABITS, HAPPY CHILD due out in 1999. Same life-changing concepts, but with additional testamonials from parents who've used this book so successfully in the past.A pediatrician with thirty-two years of experience, Marc Weissbluth, M.D., is also a leading researcher on sleep and children. He founded the original Sleep Disorders Center at Chicago&#x2019;s Children&#x2019;s Memorial Hospital and is a professor of clinical pediatrics at Northwestern University School of Medicine. Dr. Weissbluth discovered that sleep is linked to temperament and that sleeping problems are related to infant colic. His landmark seven-year study on the development and disappearance of naps highlighted the importance of daytime sleep. In addition to his own research, he has written about sleep problems in manuals of pediatrics, lectured extensively to parent groups, and appeared on Oprah. Dr. Weissbluth has four sons, two grandsons, and, thankfully, one granddaughter&#x2013;and they are all good sleepers. Linda, his wife of more than forty years, has provided both inspiration and original ideas for this book.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Discourse Analysis</h2><p>Fully revised and updated throughout, the new edition of <i>Discourse Analysis</i> is a user-friendly textbook for students taking their first course in linguistic approaches to discourse.<br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>Second edition of a popular introductory textbook, combining breadth of coverage, practical examples, and student-friendly features<br> </li> <li>Includes new sections on metaphor, framing, stance and style, multimodal discourse, and Gricean pragmatics<br> </li> <li>Considers a variety of approaches to the subject, including critical discourse analysis, conversation analysis, interactional and variationist sociolinguistics, ethnography, corpus linguistics, and other qualitative and quantitative methods<br> </li> <li>Features detailed descriptions of the results of discourse analysts&#x2019; work<br> </li> <li>Retains and expands the useful student features, including discussion questions, exercises, and ideas for small research projects.</li> </ul></p><p>This popular introductory textbook is now available in a revised and updated second edition.

The search itself is a fascinating exploration of the idea of a feminine divinity. And Sch�fer's surprising but persuasive conclusions yield deeper understanding of the complex but frequently intimate relationship between Christianity and Judaism--and of the development of religious concepts more generally.</p><br><p> Toward the end of the twelfth century, a small book titled the Bahir (Light) appeared in Provence. The first document of Judaism's emerging kabbalistic movement, it introduced a completely new view of God, one that included a divine potency that was essentially female. This female divinity was portrayed both as a mediator between Jews and God and as part of the Godhead itself. Examining Judaic history from the biblical Wisdom tradition to the Middle Ages, Sch�fer finds some precedents for the Kabbalah's feminine divinity. But he cannot account for her forceful appearance in twelfth-century southern France without reference to the immediate Christian environment, particularly the flourishing veneration of the Virgin Mary. Indeed, twelfth-century Jews and Christians were simultaneously rediscovering the feminine as an aspect of the Godhead after having abandoned it in favor of either an abstract, disembodied God or an exclusively male one.</p><br><p> In proposing that the medieval cult of Mary--rather than eastern Gnosticism--is the appropriate framework for understanding the feminine elements in Jewish mysticism, <i>Mirror of His Beauty</i> represents a sea change in Kabbalah and Jewish-Christian cultural studies. It shifts our attention from the Byzantine East to the Latin Christian West. And in contrast to histories that treat the development of Judaism and Christianity in isolation, it leads us to a fuller understanding of Jews and Christians living in proximity, aware of each other.</p></p><p><p>"Innovative, bold, well written, full of new insights, and based on broad scholarship and a creative imagination as well as plain old common sense, Peter Sch�fer's new study makes an important contribution to the history of Jewish mysticism, Jewish-Christian cultural studies, and the history of religions."<b>--Ivan Marcus, Yale University</b></p><p>"Reading this book is a great delight. Sch�fer deals with a fascinating issue--the history of the female deity--and, as he does so, he fully reveals the intimacy and closeness of Jewish-Christian relations during the Middle Ages. The book is provocative, written with drive, fluent in diverse literary spheres, and of major importance."<b>--Israel Jacob Yuval, Hebrew University</b></p><b>Peter Sch�fer</b> is Professor of Religion and Ronald O.

Although most theories of interpretation and editing depend on a concept of single authorship, many works are actually developed by more than one author. Stillinger examines case histories from Keats, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Mill, and T.S. Eliot, as well as from American fiction, plays, and films, demonstrating that multiple authorship is a widespread phenomenon. He shows that the reality of how an author produces a work is often more complex than is expressed in the romantic notion of the author as solitary genius. The cumulative evidence revealed in this engaging study indicates that collaboration deserves to be included in any account of authorial achievement.<br></p><p>Multiple Authorship and the Myth of Solitary Genius offers some surprising historical facts concerning collaborative literary efforts, along with a compelling case for the inclusion of multiple authorship in any account of authorial achievement.

You&#39;ll find coverage of the ethics of process: the morally questionable means--violence, deception, and corruption--that are most commonly used by public officials, as well as the ethics of policy: the valuable but often competing ends that public officials strive to achieve. Conflicting values, scarce resources, and stakes as high as life and death combine with the duties of public office to make choices among policy goals controversial and morally difficult.

Each of the four included books features an artistically crafted cover, making this boxed set a wonderful gift and keepsake.<br> <br><i>Anne of Green Gables</i> introduces orphan Anne Shirley as she first comes to Marilla and Matthew&#x2019;s home on Prince Edward Island. <i>Anne of Avonlea</i> chronicles Anne&#x2019;s misadventures as Avonlea&#x2019;s schoolteacher. <i>Anne of the Island</i> follows Anne as she sets out for Redmond College, and <i>Anne&#x2019;s House of Dreams</i> tells the story of Anne and Gilbert&#x2019;s new life together in Four Winds Harbor.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history. This lovely boxed gift collection comprises <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, <i>Anne of the Island</i>, <i>Anne of Avonlea</i>, <i>Anne of Windy Poplars</i>, <i>Anne's House of Dreams</i>, <i>Anne of Ingleside</i>, <i>Rainbow Valley</i>, and <i>Rilla of Ingleside</i>. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Now even the youngest Anne of Green Gables fans can celebrate the centennial anniversary.</p><h2>Mastering the West: Rome and Carthage at War (Ancient Warfare and Civilization)</h2><p>To say the Punic Wars (264-146 BC) were a turning point in world history is a vast understatement. This bloody and protracted conflict pitted two flourishing Mediterranean powers against one another, leaving one an unrivalled giant and the other a literal pile of ash. To later observers, a collision between these civilizations seemed inevitable and yet to the Romans and Carthaginians at the time hostilities first erupted seemingly out of nowhere, with what were expected to be inconsequential results.<br><br><em>Mastering the West</em> offers a thoroughly engrossing narrative of this century of battle in the western Mediterranean, while treating a full range of themes: the antagonists' military, naval, economic, and demographic resources; the political structures of both republics; and the postwar impact of the conflicts on the participants and victims. The narrative also investigates questions of leadership and the contributions and mistakes of leaders like Hannibal, Fabius the Delayer, Scipio Africanus, Masinissa, and Scipio Aemilianus. Dexter Hoyos, a leading expert of the period, treats the two great powers evenly, without neglecting the important roles played by Syracuse, Macedon, and especially Numidia. <br><br>Written with verve in a clear, accessible style, with a range of illustrations and newly-commissioned maps,<em> Mastering the West </em>will be the most reliable and engaging narrative of this pivotal era in ancient history.</p><p><br><strong>Dexter Hoyos </strong>is retired Associate Professor in Classics and Ancient History from the University of Sydney, Australia.

The authors of enormously popular works--Stegner most well known for his novels <em>The Big Rock Candy</em> <em>Mountain</em> and the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Angle of Repose</em> and DeVoto for his classic history of western exploration, <em>The Course of Empire</em>--they also played important roles in the efforts to stop government and private interests from carving up the vanishing West. Part of the fractious group of public intellectuals at Harvard that included Edmund Wilson, Mary McCarthy, and Arthur Schlesinger, Sr., they saw no contradiction between their literary and political selves and entered the public debate with conviction and passion.<br><br>Drawing on their writings, personal correspondence, and dozens of articles from the pages of <em>Harper's,</em> where DeVoto was a columnist for years, this illuminating account demonstrates how their concerns for the western environment continue to resonate today.</p><p><strong>John L. Thomas</strong> is the George L. Littlefield Professor of American History at Brown University. He is the author of several works, including <em>The Liberator: William Lloyd</em> <em>Garrison</em>.

The work created a veritable revolution. Breaking with the medium's taboos and traditions, Klein developed a radically new way of taking pictures, inventing a violent, graphic style combining black humour, social criticism, satire, and poetry.<br>"For the first time, wrote the poet and critic Alain Jouffroy, photographs led the evolution of the visual rats. Klein developed practically all of the themes dealt with later by Pop Art and the New Realism..."<br>The book whose original title was NEW YORK IS GOOD &amp; GOOD FOR YOU became a legend, an entry in rare book catalogues... and impossible to find. Therefore, a group of six European publishers, with Japanese and American partners, planned a re-edition. The design and content of this new version are considerably changed - almost a hundred more pages and dozens of never before published pictures.<br>Painter, photographer, movie maker, American in Paris, William Klein escapes pigeonholes, categories, movements.<br>Born in New York in 1928, Klein grew up on the mean streets of Manhattan, shuttling between blackboard jungles, experimental schools, pool halls and the Museum of Modern Art. At eighteen, he graduated from New York's City college and, at twenty, after serving for two years in the US Army in Europe (of which one was at the Sorbonne!), he settled in Paris to become a painter. He worked briefly with Fernand Leger and in the early fifties did kinetic murals for Italian architects, absorbing along the way European visual history from Masaccio to the Bauhaus.<br>In 1954, after six years of experimenting in painting, graphic design, and abstract photography, he returned to New York, where he embarked on a complicated love-hate affair with his native city that became an unique photographic adventure. Half amazed foreigner, half streetwise New Yorker, he set out to record on film his vision in a photographic diary.</p><p>In 1954 Klein returned to the city of his youth after living the life of a painter in Paris since the end of World War II. Vogue art director Alexander Liberman had agreed to pay him to photograph the city for a few months, though he was almost totally lacking in knowledge of or experience with a camera. The result was a collection of exuberant, cinematic images of the city's people and neighborhoods-by Klein's own description "pseudo-ethnography, parody, and Dada"-that Conde Nast never saw fit to publish. Reminiscent of Weegee in their grittiness, but with more humor and less sensationalism, and of Robert Frank in their unity of personal vision but not as bleak, the photographs are as vibrant today as when they were taken. Klein did publish a collection of these photos in Paris in 1956 in a book that is now a much-sought-after collector's item, but the man who went on to become a successful fashion and documentary photographer never saw this unique series widely exhibited or published in his home country-until now. Last year the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art presented these photos as part of its inaugural exhibits. And at long last libraries with an interest in photography will be able to pick up this selection of celebratory, quintessentially American images.

Davidson examines the cosmologies and theories of human and active intellect in the three philosophers and covers such subjects as: the emanation of the supernal realm from the First Cause; the emanation of the lower world from the transcendent active intellect; stages of human intellect; illumination of the human intellect by the transcendent active intellect; conjunction of the human intellect with the transcendent active intellect; prophecy; and human immortality.

Davidson is at University of California, Los Angeles.</p><h2>Between the Ancients and Moderns: Baroque Culture in Restoration England</h2><p>The quarrel between the ancients and the moderns was an old dispute when it was resumed with special ferocity in the later seventeenth century as writers and artists, their friends and patrons, debated how far to imitate the classics and how far to risk the freedom to innovate. In this book Joseph M. Levine argues that it was this tension that gave unity to the cultural life of the period and helped define its baroque character. He also asserts that, contrary to public opinion, neither side won&#x2015;even as modern superiority was being proclaimed in philosophy and the sciences, the precedence of the ancients was being reaffirmed in literature and the arts.<br><br>Levine offers a nuanced account of the seventeenth-century climate of ideas by examining the careers and intellectual lives of four prominent individuals and setting them among their friends and enemies: diarist John Evelyn; poet, playwright, and critic John Dryden; exiled French aristocrat Sieur de Saint-Evremond; and scientist and architect Christopher Wren. He shows how each of these men began with a self-consciously modern position but after much vacillation ended by accepting a surprising dose of "anciennete." In being among the first to explore these issues, argues Levine, these four men offered a prelude to the Battle of the Books and eighteenth-century neoclassicism. And in their uncertainty and anxiety they may also be seen as anticipating something of the later dilemmas of modernity.</p><p><b>Joseph M.

At first, the stranded boys cooperate, attempting to gather food, make shelters, and maintain signal fires. Overseeing their efforts are Ralph, "the boy with fair hair," and Piggy, Ralph's chubby, wisdom-dispensing sidekick whose thick spectacles come in handy for lighting fires. Although Ralph tries to impose order and delegate responsibility, there are many in their number who would rather swim, play, or hunt the island's wild pig population. Soon Ralph's rules are being ignored or challenged outright. His fiercest antagonist is Jack, the redheaded leader of the pig hunters, who manages to lure away many of the boys to join his band of painted savages. The situation deteriorates as the trappings of civilization continue to fall away, until Ralph discovers that instead of being hunters, he and Piggy have become the hunted: "He forgot his words, his hunger and thirst, and became fear; hopeless fear on flying feet." Golding's gripping novel explores the boundary between human reason and animal instinct, all on the brutal playing field of adolescent competition. <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i>Few works in literature have received as much popular and critical attention as Nobel Laureate William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Since its publication in 1954, it has amassed a cult following, and has significantly contributed to our dystopian vision of the post-war era. When responding to the novel's dazzling power of intellectual insight, scholars and critics often invoke the works of Shakespeare, Freud, Rousseau, Sartre, Orwell, and Conrad.<p>Golding's aim to "trace the defect of society back to the defect of human nature" is elegantly pursued in this gripping adventure tale about a group of British schoolboys marooned on a tropical island. Alone in a world of uncharted possibilities, devoid of adult supervision or rules, the boys attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin, and evil. Part parable, allegory, myth, parody, political treatise, and apocalyptic vision, Lord of the Flies is perhaps the most memorable tale about "the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart".</p></p><h2>Humberto Sp�ndola: Interventions in the Architecture of Lu�s Barrag�n: Homage to Chucho Reyes</h2><p>Humberto Sp�ndola devises interventions in the architecture of Luis Barrag�n using traditional Mexican colored tissue paper.</p><p></p><h2>Startupland: How Three Guys Risked Everything to Turn an Idea into a Global Business</h2><p><b>The real story of what it takes to risk it all and go for broke.</b> <p>Conventional wisdom says most startups need to be in Silicon Valley, started by young engineers around a sexy new idea, and backed by VC funding.

It starts by considering the early embryonic circulation, where blood passes through the valveless tube heart at a rate that surpasses the contractions of its walls, suggesting that the blood is not propelled by the heart, but possesses its own motive force, tightly coupled to the metabolic demands of the tissues.&nbsp; Rather than being an organ of propulsion, the heart, on the contrary, serves as a damming-up organ, generating pressure by rhythmically impeding the flow of blood. The validity of this model is then confirmed by comparing the key developmental stages of the cardiovascular system in the invertebrates, the insects and across the vertebrate taxa. The salient morphological and histological features of the myocardium are reviewed with particular reference to the vortex. The complex, energy-dissipating intracardiac flow-patterns likewise suggest that the heart functions as an organ of impedance, whose energy consumption closely matches the generated pressure, but not its throughput. Attention is then turned to the regulation of cardiac output and to the arguments advanced by proponents of the &#x2018;left ventricular&#x2019; and of the &#x2018;venous return&#x2019; models of circulation. Hyperdynamic states occurring in arteriovenous fistulas and congenital heart defects, where communication exists between the systemic and pulmonary circuits at the level of atria or the ventricles, demonstrate that, once the heart is unable to impede the flow of blood, reactive changes occur in the pulmonary and systemic circulations, leading to pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome. Finally, the key points of the nook are summarized in the context of blood as a &#x2018;liquid organ&#x2019; with autonomous movement.</p><p><p>What drives the circulation?&nbsp; In this comprehensive review of existing circulation models, the conventional view that the heart is a pressure-propulsion pump is challenged. The existing models fail to explain an increasing number of observed circulatory phenomena.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A unifying circulation model is proposed in which the blood, responding to metabolic demands of the tissues, is the primary regulator of cardiac output. This new model arises<i> </i>from accumulated clinical and experimental evidence. The heart, rather than being an organ of blood propulsion, assumes a secondary role and generates pressure by impeding the flow of blood. This is supported by examples from the fields of early embryonic circulation, comparative phylogeny, functional morphology, exercise physiology and a range of clinical scenarios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Heart and Circulation: An Integrative Model</i> offers a paradigm shift in the understanding of circulatory phenomena<i>. </i>It will become a valuable resource for all those clinicians, researchers, educators and students who, having been confronted with the paradox of the circulation, are looking for a broader interpretation.</p><p>Branko Furst, MD, FFARCSI, graduated from University of Ljubljana Medical School, Slovenia in 1978 and spent a year practicing family medicine.

Drawing on a vast array of primary source material, Chopra traces their journey and eventual transformation into refugees, empire builders&#x2014;and sometimes even slave catchers and slave owners. Chopra&#x2019;s compelling tale, encompassing three distinct regions of the British Atlantic, will be read by scholars across a range of fields.</p><p><b>Ruma Chopra</b> is professor of history at San Jos� State University and the author of <i>Unnatural Rebellion: Loyalists in New York City During the Revolution</i> and <i>Choosing Sides: Loyalists in Revolutionary America.</i> She lives in Oakland, CA.&#x201c;Splendidly researched and argued . . .

Virtually every page contains full-color photographs of mosaics, statues, murals, and everyday objects. Four chapters outline the Roman power structure and major players, the classes of citizens, discord in Caesar's armies, and the early Olympic games. Personal accounts offer glimpses into Roman life: beauty rituals, marriage customs, entertainment, superstitions, trades, and burial rites, to name a few.

Though she was widely known for her supernatural fictions, Lee hasn&#x2019;t gained the recognition she so clearly deserves for her contributions in the fields of aesthetics, philosophy of empathy, and art criticism. An early follower of Walter Pater, her work is characterized by extreme attention to her own responses to artworks, and a level of psychological sensitivity rarely seen in any aesthetic writing. Today, she is largely overlooked in curriculums, her aesthetic works long out of print. David Zwirner Books is reintroducing Lee&#x2019;s writing through the first-ever English publication of "Psychology of an Art Writer" (1903) along with selections from her groundbreaking "Gallery Diaries" (1901&#x2013;1904), breathtaking accounts of Lee&#x2019;s own experiences with the great paintings and sculptures she traveled to see. Ranging from deeply felt assessments of the way mood affects our ability to appreciate art, to detailed descriptions of some of the most powerful personal experiences with artworks, these writings provide profound insights into the fields of psychology and aesthetics. Her philosophical inquiries in The Psychology of an Art Writer leave no stone unturned, combining fine-grained ekphrases with high fancy and dense abstraction. The diaries, in turn, establish Lee as one of the most sensitive writers about art in any language. With a foreword by Berkeley classicist Dylan Kenny, which guides the reader through these writings and contextualizes these texts within Lee&#x2019;s other work, this is the quintessential introduction to her astonishing and complex oeuvre.</p><p>Under the pseudonym Vernon Lee, Violet Paget (1856&#x2013;1935) published a bewildering variety of work, including historical studies; meditative essays on art, music, gardens, and travel; philosophical dialogues; treatises on aesthetic theory and psychology; and supernatural tales. Born to a cosmopolitan English family, she settled in Florence, where she maintained friendships with artists and intellectuals throughout the world, including John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, Edith Wharton, J.A. Symonds, Walter Pater, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and G.B. Shaw. In close collaboration with her partner, the artist Kit Anstruther-Thompson, she was one of the first English thinkers to seriously engage with German empathy theory. Together, they tried to capture the mysterious and complex workings of art on our bodies, our minds, and our social lives; one of the fruits of this investigation was the 1912 volume Beauty and Ugliness, which included and analyzed long excerpts from Lee&#x2019;s own Gallery Diaries. Partially as a result of her strong pacifist politics and opposition to World War I, Lee became somewhat estranged from the literary establishment, although she continued to write prolifically until her death.A recently published volume of Vernon Lee&#x2019;s writing reveals a woman who is a product of privilege, as well as someone who used what it afforded her to resist the status quo. (Alexis Clements <i>Hyperallergic</i>)<br><br>What's striking about Lee's writing here is the openness and what one might almost describe as the nakedness with which she embraces the multiplying sensations and apprehensions that shape her experience. (Jed Perl <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>What a find. And what an important book for today. But then, what we are given is more subtle. Lee&#x2019;s way of appreciating art, examining why you feel it but never questioning whether this feeling has value, begs to be read now.

Spurred by rediscoveries of &#x2018;first&#x2019; photographs and proclamations of photography&#x2019;s death in the digital age, scholars have been rethinking who and what invented the medium. <p><i>Photography and Its Origins</i> reflects on this interest in photography&#x2019;s beginnings by reframing it in critical and specifically historiographical terms. How and why do we write about the origins of the medium? Whom or what do we rely on to construct those narratives? What&#x2019;s at stake in choosing to tell stories of photography&#x2019;s genesis in one way or another? And what kind of work can those stories do? </p> <p>Edited by Tanya Sheehan and Andr�s Mario Zervig�n, this collection of 16 original essays, illustrated with 32 colour images, showcases prominent and emerging voices in the field of photography studies.

Rather than merely revisiting well known origin stories and protagonists, the volume takes a critical approach to the theme itself by asking why origins matter to us. It also makes a larger point; by addressing photography's origins beyond the Western canon it finally brings places and people into the centre of research that have hitherto been neglected." </p><p>Mirjam Brusius, Mellon Post-doctoral Fellow in the History of Photography, University of Oxford </p><p>"This collection of essays significantly advances our understanding of the prehistory and origins of photography. Expanding the intellectual and geographic boundaries has allowed new narratives to emerge and challenge the traditional chronicles that have previously dominated the field.

Since colonial times southerners have held barbecues to mark homecomings, reunions, and political campaigns; today barbecue signifies celebration as much as ever. In a lively and amusing style, Reed traces the history of southern barbecue from its roots in the sixteenth-century Caribbean, showing how this technique of cooking meat established itself in the coastal South and spread inland from there. He discusses how choices of meat, sauce, and cooking methods came to vary from one place to another, reflecting local environments, farming practices, and history.<br><br>Reed hopes to preserve the South's barbecue traditions by providing the home cook with fifty-one recipes for many classic varieties of barbecue and for the side dishes, breads, and desserts that usually go with it. Featured meats range from Pan-Southern Pork Shoulder to Barbecued Chicken Two Ways to West Texas Beef Ribs, while rubs and sauces include Memphis Pork Rub, Piedmont Dip, and Lone Star Sauce and Mop. Cornbread, hushpuppies, and slaw are featured side dishes, and Dori's Peach Cobbler and Pig-Pickin' Cake provide a sweet finish.

They were performing mesmerism. Surprisingly central to literature and culture of the period, mesmerism embraced a variety of phenomena, including mind control, spirit travel, and clairvoyance. Although it had been debunked by Benjamin Franklin in late eighteenth-century France, the practice nonetheless enjoyed a decades-long resurgence in the United States. Emily Ogden here offers the first comprehensive account of those boom years.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Credulity </i>tells the fascinating story of mesmerism&#x2019;s spread from the plantations of the French Antilles to the textile factory cities of 1830s New England. As it proliferated along the Eastern seaboard, this occult movement attracted attention from Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x2019;s circle and ignited the nineteenth-century equivalent of flame wars in the major newspapers. But mesmerism was not simply the last gasp of magic in modern times. Far from being magicians themselves, mesmerists claimed to provide the first rational means of manipulating the credulous human tendencies that had underwritten past superstitions. Now, rather than propping up the powers of oracles and false gods, these tendencies served modern ends such as labor supervision, education, and mediated communication. Neither an atavistic throwback nor a radical alternative, mesmerism was part and parcel of the modern. <i>Credulity</i> offers us a new way of understanding the place of enchantment in secularizing America.</p><p><b>Emily Ogden</b> is assistant professor of English at the University of Virginia.<br>"<i>Credulity&nbsp;</i>is an extraordinary achievement. It is the best kind of interdisciplinary American studies scholarship, deftly navigating canonical American literature, critical theory, and archival sources, presenting them in sharp and engaging prose. Very few works of scholarship are both intensely smart and deeply pleasurable to read (and most are neither), but&nbsp;<i>Credulity&nbsp;</i>surely is, and it repays close, careful reading and rereading." (Charles McCrary <i>Bulletin for the Study of Religion</i>)<br><br>"Mesmerism is an enthralling subject, and Emily Ogden has produced a particularly subtle history of its multiple embodiments in the nineteenth-century United States. . . . Throughout the book Ogden displays an impressive command over (and rapport with) her mesmerist archive. She uses that familiarity to question the ways in which scholars have been too enamored with enlightened notions of autonomy, agency, and empowerment to appreciate fully the mischief-making of mediums, somnambulists, and mesmeric subjects. Likewise, though, she sows doubt about the scholarly enchantment with enchantment&#x2014;that it is not so much a mode of romantic resistance to rational disciplines, but another contrivance for modern operators to deploy against those who have not made similar progress toward secular modernity. Believe me,&nbsp;<i>Credulity&nbsp;</i>is a clever book."<br> &nbsp; (Leigh E. Schmidt <i>Reading Religion</i>)<br><br>"What distinguishes Ogden&#x2019;s account is her trenchant analysis of the various explanations proposed by mesmerism&#x2019;s modern-aiming critics. . . . Among Ogden&#x2019;s keen insights is her observation that iconoclasm invariably requires manufacturing one&#x2019;s own unproven causal agency. . . . .Religious studies scholars will welcome <i>Credulity </i>as a lively assessment of the way that accusations of delusion or chicanery signal the gradual emergence of a secular consensus. They will particularly appreciate Ogden&#x2019;s judgment that this process is mostly circuitous. . . . Ogden successfully supplements . . . previous histories by posing new questions and bringing fresh analyses to mesmerism&#x2019;s somewhat paradoxical complicity in the emergence of both modern secularism and modern metaphysical religion." (<i>Journal of Religion</i>)<br><br>"A vivid account of the jagged intersections of science, modernity, and enchantment in the history of mesmerism, from its first flowering in eighteenth century France to its ambiguous fizzling half a century later in the United States. Ogden argues that mesmerism, rather than a clear-cut illustration of something like enchantment or disenchantment, lands in a contorted S-shape across those categories." (Donovan Schaefer <i>The Immanent Frame</i>)<br><br>"Ogden's marvelous book shows what secularism loves and not just what it hates, what it desires and not just what it wishes to get rid of;&nbsp;<i>Credulity</i>&nbsp;is, among other things, a study of 'debunking's pleasures.'" (Caleb Smith <i>The Immanent Frame</i>)<br><br>"The problems Emily Ogden deals with in her new book are by no means confined to the antebellum period on which she focuses. . . . <i>Credulity</i> is less a fully detailed narrative of mesmerism's ups and downs than a laser-focused inquiry into the constitutive role 'irrational' belief plays in maintaining rational supremacy." (Clare Coffey <i>New Atlantis</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Ogden&#x2019;s book adds to the literature in that it does not simply relate the history of mesmerism and its skeptics during the antebellum period. Rather, Ogden reveals the ways in which mesmerists and skeptics alike used mesmerism to their advantage in an emerging modern era. This interdisciplinary work will appeal to those interested in 19th-century history, secularism, and literature in the US. . . . Recommended.&#x201d; (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Ogden&#x2019;s analysis is full of surprises: strange tales culled from the archives, poignant accounts of the lives of mesmerized clairvoyants, and electrical flashes of insight into the relations between secular rationalism and the occult. As Ogden waves her wand over the period, she reanimates a number of antebellum classics, including Melville&#x2019;s <i>Moby-Dick</i>, Hawthorne&#x2019;s <i>The Blithedale Romance</i>, Poe&#x2019;s 'Tale of the Ragged Mountains,'&nbsp;and Emerson&#x2019;s 'Experience.'&nbsp;<i>Credulity</i> is one of the best books in American cultural studies I&#x2019;ve read in years.&#x201d; (<i>Benjamin Reiss, Emory University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Marshaling&nbsp;a truly astonishing array of firsthand research, Ogden&#x2019;s wonderful <i>Credulity</i>&nbsp;provides the first full-scale history of the fascinating phenomenon of mesmerism in the United States. &nbsp;Ogden not only offers&nbsp;elegant and innovative readings of major nineteenth-century novels and unjustly neglected works alike, but reframes some of the most hotly contested questions in contemporary scholarship:&nbsp;the status of modernity as a 'secular age,' the fate within it of&nbsp;&#x2018;enchantment,' and the idealization of agency. <i>Credulity</i>&nbsp;is an enormously exciting book argued with great verve, clarity, and finesse.&#x201d; (<i>Jennifer Fleissner, Indiana University, Bloomington</i>)<br><br>"What fine, fierce intelligence is here: with the deftest command of archival, literary, and theoretical sources and diamond-cut clarity of prose, Emily Ogden brings enchantment into view as a transaction by which the credulity of some ensures the modernity of others.&nbsp; A tool and not the vanquished other of enlightenment, the discourse of enchantment helped Americans who 'aimed at modernity' to negotiate the place of fiction, the management and monetization of labor, the conduct of colonialism, the care and company of the disabled, and the demands of secular agency. If I had a single book to recommend to students of nineteenth-century American culture, or to all who take pleasure in exquisite reading and writing,&nbsp;<i>Credulity</i> would be it."

In his friendly and welcoming style, he shows how math developed from basic faculties present in us all, beginning with our "number sense"&#x2014;the ability to discern that an object has been added to or removed from a small collection of objects without counting. The subsequent evolution of the concept of number is inextricably linked with the history of human culture, as Dantzig demonstrates. He shows how advances in math were spurred by the demands of growing commerce in the ancient world; how the pure speculation of philosophers and religious mystics contributed to our understanding of numbers; how the exchange of ideas between cultures in times of war and imperial conquest fueled advances in knowledge; and, ultimately, how the forces of history combine with human intuition to trigger revolutions in thought.</p><p>Sweeping in scope, <i>Number</i> is an open doorway into the world of math.

He describes the properties of all kinds of numbers&#x2014;integers, primes, irrationals, transcendentals, and more. He explains the significance of zero, and shows that its invention had revolutionary consequences for arithmetic. He shows how the invention of symbols for use in algebra&#x2014;a radical departure from tradition at the time&#x2014;ushered in a new era of math; how arithmetic and geometry reflect each other; and how calculus uses infinity to model the continuity of space and time.</p><p>With a new afterword, notes section, and bibliography written by math professor and author Joseph Mazur, and a new foreword by mathematician Barry Mazur, the <i>Masterpiece Science edition of Number</i>&#x2014;which was first published in 1930&#x2014;is the first update of Dantzig's classic work in over fifty years.

The authors explore the challenges each region faces, such as water shortages, climate change, increased migration and diversity, urbanization, and continued economic changes. The book also highlights the positive actions that Americans and Canadians are taking to move toward a more sustainable future. New features in the second edition include sections on population, immigration and diversity, and urban trends. Each chapter also features a case study that examines a national park (representing natural and cultural heritage), how the region is coping with climate change, how geospatial technologies are applied to environmental challenges, iconic images and/or cultural festivals, urban sustainability best practices, and global connections and networks. Designed for ease of teaching and learning, the book features full-color photographs and maps throughout, chapter highlights, lists of key terms, places, and major cities for each chapter, discussion questions, and a glossary. <br></p><p>Lisa Benton-Short is professor and chair of the Department of Geography at George Washington University.

Chris Mayda (d. 2016) was professor of geography and sustainability at Eastern Michigan University.<br>A comprehensive review of introductory themes in geography presented through a multiregional framework for North America. The focus on environmental concerns and sustainability is interwoven throughout the text and represents a vital aspect of geography that is missing from similar college textbooks. (Donald C. Williams, Western New England University)<br><br>Lisa Benton-Short and John Rennie Short have done a masterful job with this major revision of the late Chris Mayda&#x2019;s work. Retaining the best of the first edition, they have embedded that content within a concise and streamlined framework and brought new clarity to key concepts. Students using the second edition should readily grasp the logic behind the book&#x2019;s sustainability focus and appreciate the new features on sustainability best practices and on geospatial illumination of regional issues, alongside Mayda&#x2019;s explorations of systems thinking on environmental problems. The revised edition will serve instructors well for engaged and critical approaches to the teaching of North American regional geography. (G. Rebecca Dobbs, Western Carolina University)<br><br>The second edition of A Regional Geography of the United States and Canada powerfully and systematically links basic concepts, theories of sustainability, and the importance of place. Social scientists and others interested in why regions are different, how those differences emerge over time, as well as implications for the future will find this book indispensable. (Cornelia B. Flora, Iowa State University)<br><br>In this second edition, Lisa Benton-Short and John Rennie Short very carefully complement the late Chris Mayda's life project with their own distinctive expertise in human geography and urbanization. In doing so, they preserve her personal and intellectual legacy while providing additional insight and expertise. Thus, readers continue to have a book that &#x2018;has heart,&#x2019; is built directly from a geographer&#x2019;s travel observations and interactions with the landscape, pays heed to sustainability as perhaps the leading issue of our time. I look forward to my continued use of this book for years to come! (George Pomeroy, Shippensburg University)</p><h2>The Peoples of the British Isles: A New History.
